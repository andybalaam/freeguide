<h1>The old Future TODO list</h1>
<div class='indent'><em>This list is out of date: we are now using a bug tracker here: <a class='urllink' href='http://bugs.launchpad.net/freeguide-tv/+bugs' rel='nofollow'>http://bugs.launchpad.net/freeguide-tv/+bugs</a></em>
</div><p class='vspace'>This is what we plan to do in future versions of <span class='wikiword'>FreeGuide</span>.  To see what we are doing now, check out the current <a class='wikilink' href='TODOList.html'>TODO list</a>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Time flows downwards in this document
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Free Java</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> - Look into packaging as binaries on Windows and Linux.
 - Test with a Java 1.4 runtime
 - Look into the compile warning we get in src/freeguide/plugins/program/freeguide/FreeGuide.java</pre>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Features</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> - Notice "Please run --configure" in the command output, cancel downloading
   and launch "Choose channels".</pre>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Power favourites</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> - Integrate Favourites, List view and Search?
 - Favourites match on sub-title
 - Favourites match on description
 - Favourites define display colour
 - Favourites match on whether or not a programme is a repeat.
 - Favourites match on movie
 - Favourites match on category
 - Remember last hit-time of favourites
 - Allow sorting of favourites list on name, hit-time and filter by category
 - Maintenance
   - Make sure any new XMLTV grabbers such as Croatia (tv_grab_hr)
     are supported by Freeguide
   - "Add new XMLTV grabber" config boxes should be labeled and provide examples
     of what to type</pre>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Harder bugs and small features</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> - Fix the "Search fails if more than 7 days' listings downloaded" bug reported by Jim Pera here: http://www.nabble.com/bug-in-freeguide-tf4040989.html
 - Bugs we have seen but need to replicate:
   - From the first time wizard (on win2k), I chose to run config, and then
     chose to download listings.  The window disappeared completely.
   - Configuration didn't seem to work during first time wizard - why?
   - Sometimes my XMLTV grabber gets deleted, and XMLTV is unchecked in
     the grabbers section in Options
 - Select programmes and channels for export and print:
   - by channels(all/one/channelset)
   - by date(all/today or selected/from-to)
   - by selection(all/only selected)
 - Add pack(.gz) option for export
 - Change xmltv setup to support XmltvCapabilities and XMLTV::Ask
 - Change plugin/ui/horizontal to show site information(like "NTV, VseTV" instead "NTV")
 - Get Andy's friend Mattias to do a Swedish translation
 - Get Andy's friend Azam to do an Indonesian translation
 - Get Andy's friend Pete to do an Afrikaans translation
 - Fix double byte to single byte character conversion issues (o-acute is replaced by
   2 characters) see [http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Freeguide-tv-beta-testing--FreeGuide-0.10.4-Release-Candidate-Testing-tf2022627.html#a5561257 this thread]
 - Allow changing the font in the programme description panel and the personalised guide
 - On Windows install, handle problems with the command line being too long to
   fit into a shortcut.
 - Remember "Show details" setting, and don't close download window if details
   are being shown.
 - Fix bug with multiple reminders if you enter a page multiple times.
 - Fix the problem reported by Russell Odom on 24/09/04 to do with the channel
   list not staying up to date when you reconfigure.
 - Fix the old channels hanging around bug - see Yann's email of 15/11/04
 - Fix the bug with a favourite that matches everything appearing - see my email
   of 2005-01-05.
 - Fix bad characters being displayed in Tk GUI of XMLTV (entering username).
 - Fix Go to now at 4am going to yesterday
 - When you enter the Options screen the tree view should be expanded already
 - Redesign the Options screen to make it simpler and more task-focussed
     - Can we get rid of a lot of options for the horizontal display?
 - Increase the sizes of buttons in Channel Sets, Options and First Time Wizard
   so that they fit under the German translation.
 - Make _pt use tv_unprocessed method like uk_rt
 - Fix bug where vertical scrolling makes the cursor disappear
 - Fix cropped channel icons in program details panel
 - If a link for a program in the "personalized tv guide" is clicked, the
   program view scrolls to it. It would be also nice if the detail view
   would change to it.
 - after clicking on the "Edit channel sets" item in the channel set
   dropdown, it stays selected. It would be nice if the previous selected
   item would be selected again.
 - Check where each repaint event comes from and make sure it is only called
   once for every time it needs to be called.
 - Make 00:00 starts after time in favourites _either_ late at night _or_ early
   in the morning depending what the starts before time is - see debian bug
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=285719
 - Clicking in the personalised listing window jumps the strip view to the
   right time, but not the right programme.
 - Check what happens (if anything?) if you don't set TZ
 - Improve visibility of the fact that the downloading is still going on when
   you've clicked the X in the downloading window.
 - Don't scroll left or right when you press the up or down button to navigate
   between programmes (unless the programme you have not selected is entirely off
   the screen)
 - Make channel labels wide enough to fit channel name and icon.
 - Make a "Change Channels" button that links through to change the settings of
   the grabber(s) you are using.
 - Report e.g. parsing errors during download to the Show Details panel
 - Make the XMLTV plugin optionally save out the raw XML it downloaded for debug.
 - Supply a default config file for each XMLTV grabber so that you get something
   even if config didn't work.
 - Create an ant build target that makes a "run" directory that contains all the
   jar files needed etc to run freeguide (and preferably puts a little
   "freeguide" script in there to run it using the correct directories)
 - Move "First Time Wizard" and "Plugins manager" _inside_ the Options screen.
 - Sometimes when I build FreeGuide from clean and then immediately start it I
   get a Segmentation fault
 - Movies are not shown in the movie colour
 - Make sure the plugin repository really works
 - Get rid of the "user andy" messages when installing RPMs.
 - Add an FAQ about downloading more than a week's listings.
 - Make the choose font dialog bigger. 
 - Make middle-click work the same as double-click on a programme.
 - Add an "Edit this favourite" option to the right-click menu on a favourite.
 - Show original air date in tool tips.
 - Fix themeing so the theme is chosen on startup:
   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=14558299
 - Add an FAQ on how to run XMLTV from the command line
 - Explain what each mailing list is for, and give priority to the
   developers' and users' lists since they are normally what people want.
 - Command-line switch to provide a fixed time offset.
 - Modify the Grabbers node on the Options screen.  Currently it looks
   like this (where --- means this node has settings for it):
    * Grabbers ---
      * XMLTV ---
      * VSetV.com ---
      * ... ---
   but this is confusing as it is not expected that the Grabbers node
   will have settings.  So we should change it to look like this:
    * Grabbers
      * Grabbers ---
      * XMLTV ---
      * VSetV.com ---
      * ... ---
   or, better, we should put a checkbox on each grabber's page saying
   "Use this grabber", and get rid of the separate page altogether.
   Then it would look like this:
    * Grabbers
      * XMLTV ---+
      * VSetV.com ---+
      * ... ---+
   where the + means each page has a checkbox saying "Use this grabber".
 - Improve performance when there is a large number of manual selections.
 - Identify (and fix?) the word-wrap problem reported by Jim Konowitz on
   Java 1.4.2 vs 1.5.  This:
   http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;:YfiG?bug_id=4924163
   may be helpful.  It seems to suggest if you call pack() twice it
   might fix the problem.
   - Make sure long tooltips still wrap properly on java 1.5
   - Make sure tooltips clear properly (especially near the horizontal divider)
 - Fix problem with overlapping programmes caused by schedule changes.
 - If an exception is thrown reading a .ser file, delete it.
 - Clean up strange wording in the program details pane if appropriate see [[http://www.nabble.com/Another-FreeGuide-10.4-Issue-tf1989103.html|this thread]]
    - Examples: is "system: xmltv_ns; dd_progid" necessary?
    - "value TV-14" should be "rating TV-14"
    - Episode numbers should NOT be shown as "0/2" instead of "1/2",
      or "1/2" instead of "2/2", etc. (not all multi-episode programs show this bug)</pre>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Documentation and accessibility</h3>

      columns.
    - Add a Search text box to vertical viewer instead of right-click
    - Make vertical viewer indicate when its listings run from and to
    - Add options like in the search dialog for showing old programmes or
      not etc. 
 - Make it prompt to download if there are old listings, but no current ones.

<div class='vspace'></div><h3>On-hold recording release</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> - Right-clicking on a programme should give these options:
    Remind me
    Record
    Remind me of every episode
    Record every episode
  The first 2 should just affect this programme, and the second 2
  should create a favourite that is either recorded or not.
  These two types of reminder (Remind me or Record) should be
  added the first time you run FreeGuide.

 - Check that upgrading from an old version properly preserves
   your old favourites, turning them into
   "Remind me of every episode" favourites.

 - Double clicking on a show should do the same as right-clicking
   and saying "Remind me".

 - Fix the fact that FreeGuide seems to record things 1 or 2 minutes
   after you told it to.

 - Save hardware name list, instead of losing it every time

 - Change reminder section on Options screen to look like this:

   - Advanced
     - Recording and reminders
       - Channel names
       - Remind me
       - Record
       - ... user-added reminders ...
    There should be an "Add new reminder" button on BOTH
    the "Recording and reminders" page, AND on every
    reminder page (remind me, record, etc.)

 - The favourites editor should allow you to edit favourites of all
   types, and set which reminder plugin they use (i.e. add to guide
   and pop-up message, or record, or other user-defined ones)

 - Include these recording scripts:
    - mplayer (Linux, written by Andy)
    - VLC (Linux, written by Gerry)
    - A Windows one of some kind?


 - New zap2it grabber not working (XMLTV grabber is fine):
   "Error grab data by grabber 'grabber-zap2it' : Provider
   com.bea.xml.stream.MXParserFactory not found" (Dec 6 nightly)

 - New zap2it grabber needs to allow timezone offset

 - Add %length variable to recording commands that gives the time
   in the hh:mm:ss format, INCLUDING the gap before and after the
   programme.</pre>
