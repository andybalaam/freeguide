<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction </h2>

<p>FreeGuide is a TV guide programme. It uses parser programmes to extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the user to view television  listings and create customised TV guides by selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.</p>

<p>It works with listings for Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand (Linux only), Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US.</p>

<p>FreeGuide is written by the <a href="contributors.html">FreeGuide contributors</a> (copyright 2001-2003).  Please do send code, ideas, bugs and comments to <a href="mailto:freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.  FreeGuide's home page is at <a href="http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net">http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net</a>. You can contact the lead developer, Andy Balaam at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR), University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.</p>

<p>FreeGuide uses the XMLTV parsers (and file format) developed by the very friendly people at XMLTV (<a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv</a>).  It also contains snippets of other code borrowed from other GPL projects: see the <a href="contributors.html">contributors</a> page for info.</p>

<h2><a name="installing"></a> Installing FreeGuide</h2>

<p>FreeGuide is written in Java, and thus should work on most types of computer.  It is developed and tested on Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Windows users should read the <a href="INSTALL-windows.html">Windows installation docs</a>.</p>

<p>Linux and other Unix-like users should read the <a href="INSTALL-linux.html">Linux installation docs</a>.</p>

<p>Other people should try following the Linux instructions, but note that you will definitely need Java 1.4, which may be a problem on Mac OS.</p>

<h2><a name="running"></a>Using FreeGuide</h2>

<p>The first time you run FreeGuide it will check that everything is set up correctly, and allow you to change things if something's gone wrong.  If you followed the installation instructions for your platform exactly, but you get an error here, it's a bug - sorry! - <a href="mailto:freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">contact</a> the developers and we'll sort you out.</p>

<!--<p>NOTE: On Linux you may get an error about the location of your xmltv executables.  FreeGuide looks in /usr/bin/ for these, but on RedHat and other distributions they are actually in /usr/local/bin/ - simply edit the box so that it reads /usr/local/bin/ and FreeGuide should start fine.</p>-->

<p>If all has gone well, FreeGuide will know what channels you want, but won't be able to show any programmes because you haven't downloaded them yet.  When it starts it will ask you whether you want to go to the download screen.  Connect to the Internet, and click Yes.  Cross your fingers and wait.  If all is well, the listings should eventually download (it can take some time), and you can click OK to start using FreeGuide.  If you get the "Execution Error" message, don't panic - click "Continue" and you may find that all has still worked fine.  If you continue to have problems, click "Show Output" when you get the execution error, and paste the messages you see into an email to us at <a href="mailto:freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net" >freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a> and we'll try to help.</p>

<p>Note: if you very quickly get an "Execution Error" message, check that you're connected to the Internet and try again.  If you wait quite a while and then get the "Execution Error" message, everything may still be alright - click "Continue" to see.</p>

<p>On the main screen time advances from left to right (click "Go To Now" to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below another.</p>

<p>The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can choose a day from the list.</p>

<p>You can click on a programme (making it go grey) to add it to your personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom section of the window.</p>

<p>You can make programmes highlight themselves by adding them to your favourites list (under the "Tools" menu click "Favourites").  Any programme matching a favourite will be ticked automatically.  You can always un-tick programmes if you wish.  You can also make a programme a favourite by right-clicking it and choosing "Add to Favourites".</p>

<p>Clicking "Print this personalised listing" will open up your web browser with your customised TV guide, and you can print it by choosing "File" and then "Print" in your browser.</p>

<p>To download more listings, click on "Download Listings".</p>

<p>You can create different sets of channels to display using the "Channel Sets" option on the "Tools" menu.  You can choose a channel set with the dropdown list at the top-right of the main screen.</p>

<p>Check out the "Tools" menu to customise FreeGuide and alter various options.</p>

<h2><a name="notes"></a>Notes and Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Replacing your XMLTV grabber</h3>

<p>If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.  Check the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv">XMLTV page</a> for updated parsers.  To replace your XMLTV version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under Windows unzip the xmltv-x_x_x-win32.zip file and copy the file xmltv.exe over your file "C:\Program Files\freeguide-tv\xmltv\xmltv.exe"</li>
<li>Under Linux, just install it as usual.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can't configure the grabber</h3>

<p>If your grabber fails to configure or run because it can't seem to get any data from the Internet, it may be because you need to use a proxy server.  In the following replace "proxy.uni.ac.uk" with your proxy server address, and "8080" with the port it uses.  On Windows you can find these out from the "Tools" menu on Internet Explorer by choosing "Options", going to the "Connections" tab and clicking "LAN Settings":</p>

<h4>With Windows 2000/XP:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Right Click "My Computer" -> Properties</li>
<li>Choose the Advanced Tab and click the Environment Variables button at the bottom middle of the window.</li>
<li>Click the "New" button in the Global Variables section.</li>
<li>Variable Name: http_proxy</li>
<li>Variable Value: http://proxy.uni.ac.uk:8080</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ul>
<h4>With Windows 95/98/ME:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line "set http_proxy=http://proxy.uni.ac.uk:8080" to the file C:\Autoexec.bat</li>
<li>Restart your computer</li>
</ul>
<h4>With Linux:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bash users: Add a line "export http_proxy=http://proxy.uni.ac.uk:8080" to the file ~/.bash_profile</li>
</ul>

<h4>Authenticating Proxies</h4>

<p>If you have an authenticating proxy, try "user:password@proxy.uni.ac.uk:8080" replacing "user" with your username and "password" with your password.</p>

<h3>Timezones</h3>
	
<p>FreeGuide may benefit from setting your environment variable "TZ" to your time zone. ("EST5EDT" refers to New York timezone, so you'll need to adjust it, e.g to "GMT" for London.)  Here's how:</p>
<h4>With Windows 2000/XP:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Right Click "My Computer" -> Properties</li>
<li>Choose the Advanced Tab and click the Environment Variables button at the bottom middle of the window.</li>
<li>Click the "New" button in the Global Variables section.</li>
<li>Variable Name: TZ</li>
<li>Variable Value: EST5EDT</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ul>
<h4>With Windows 95/98/ME:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add a line "set TZ=EST5EDT" to the file c:\autoexec.bat</li>
<li>Restart your computer</li>
</ul>
<h4>With Linux:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bash users: Add a line "export TZ=EST5EDT" to the file ~/.bash_profile</li>
</ul>

<!--<p>Support for New Zealand listings doesn't appear to work as far as I can tell, so I'm calling it "experimental".  Let me know if you have any success with this.  I <i>think</i> the grabber provided with XMLTV 0.5.7 just doesn't work for some reason.  If you do use the nz grabber, you'll have to leave the preference setting for grabber config file location as %home%/.xmltv/tv_grab_nz since the grabber is unable to use a file in a different location.</p>-->

<h3>Missing listings after a successful download</h3>

<p>If you grab some listings late in a day, nearing the grabber's idea of the end of a day (e.g. close to 6am for the UK grabber) then you may be told that there are missing listings for that day even though you've just grabbed new listings.  This is because the grabbing has started from tomorrow, so what's left of today doesn't have a full set of listings.  Don't worry about this - just say "No" and you should be able to see what you need.</p>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>You may like to check out our <a href="TODO">TODO</a> list.</p>

<p>If you use the North American grabber on Linux it will never overwrite listings files that already exist.  If you want it to overwrite a particular file, delete it from ~/.freeguide-tv/.</p>

<p>If FreeGuide won't work for you, why not make it work?  If you're having trouble, ask us and we'll be glad to help.</p>
