<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>FreeGuide is a TV guide program. It uses parser programs to extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the user to view television  listings and create customised TV guides by selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.</p>

<p>It works with listings for Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand (Linux only), Spain, the UK and the US.</p>

<h2><a name="installing"></a> Installing FreeGuide</h2>

<p>If you are in North America, you need to get a Data Direct account from Zap2it before you install FreeGuide.  To do this, go to <a href="http://labs.zap2it.com">http://labs.zap2it.com</a> and click the "New User? Sign-Up" link.  Use the certificate code <tt>TUYO-DCXM-CBUT</tt>.  Make a note of the username and password you choose as you will need to enter them during the installation process.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<ul>

<li>Make sure you've got Java version 1.4 or above.  (<a href="FAQ.html#javaversion">How do I know?</a>)</li>

<li>Set your timezone. (<a href="timezone.html">How?</a>)</li>

<li>Download the file FreeGuide-X.X-Win-Install.jar from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309&package_id=27789">download page</a> and double-click on it to run it, and follow the instructions to install FreeGuide and configure your grabber.</li>

<li>Find the file "C:\Program Files\freeguide-tv\FreeGuide.jar" in "My Computer" and double-click on it to run FreeGuide.  If you like, you can make a shortcut to this file (by right-clicking and choosing "Create Shortcut") and put it on your desktop (by dragging it onto the desktop).</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have problems try looking for an answer in the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<!--<ul>
<li>Make sure you've got Java version 1.4 or above.  (<a href="FAQ.html#javaversion">How do I know?</a>)</li>

<li>Set your timezone. (<a href="timezone.html">How?</a>)</li>

<li>Now you have a choice.  You can either do it the easy way, and continue following these instructions, or you can choose to build your own XMLTV, which is explained <a href="INSTALL-linux-noxmltv.html">here</a>.  If you're from New Zealand you'll have to do it the hard way.</li>

<li>Download the file FreeGuide-X.X-Linux-Install.jar from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309&package_id=27789">download page</a> and run it by opening a terminal, cd-ing to the directory where you downloaded it, and doing "java -jar FreeGuide-X.X-Linux-Install.jar", replacing the X's with the version number, obviously.  Follow the instructions to install FreeGuide and configure your grabber.</li>

<li>To run FreeGuide open a terminal and cd to the directory you chose as the installation directory.  Run it with "java -jar FreeGuide.jar".</li>

</ul>-->
