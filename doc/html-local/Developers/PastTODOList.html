   + Check that all the FAQs are still relevant.

   tie down to a specific click here and this happens.  When not on the 
   current day, if you double click on a program it will select a different

   bottom of the current screen at either 1/2 or 1 hour later in the day.

   but icon and name is displayed on All Channels.
 a Make it repaint correctly when you press "f" on a programme, or double-click
 a Sometimes you can't click on certain programmes, but you can navigate to them
   with the keyboard
 a Make Startup.java accept "--install_directory x" as well as
   "--install_directory=x"
 a Make simple tar.gz packages for e.g. Slackware, and so that other
   packagers can base on that, e.g. Mac OS.
 a When there are no listings for today FreeGuide should immediately ask whether
   you want to download as soon as it starts.
 a Opera should have the command 'opera -newpage "%filename%"'

     There was any kind of error

</pre>
<h3>Release 0.10.2 (plugins manager, bug fixes)</h3>
<pre class='escaped'> 

 + Go through all the files that mention the version number and set the version
   automatically, instead of hard-coding.  Don't break eclipse etc. support.
   Do this in the ant "compile" task.
 a Reminders are never removed.  They should disappear after the time the user
   has set.
 + Make a new Windows installer containing all the plugins
 + Make RPMs for each plugin, and make the freeguide-base and freeguide-all
   RPMs.
 + Put latest XMLTV in Windows version
 a Favourites are not automatically added to the guide
 a Exiting from the File menu does not exit properly
 a Keyboard shortcuts for adding a programme to favourites and adding to guide
   do not work.
 a "Remind me of progs" option does not stay unchecked.  I was able to get it to s tick by editing 
   the registry, though.
 a "Width of 1hr" change has no effect.  I didn't see a setting for that in the registry.
 a double-click to add to guide not working as it did in 0.10pre1
 a favorites from upgrade don't include channel or day details when clicking on edit, but are shown
   in the main favorites window.  In addition, these missing details are not applied to which
   programs are selected.  However, the time details are shown &amp; applied.  Editing upgraded favorites
   to re-include these details still doesn't show in the edit dialog, but they are now properly
   applied to which programs are selected.
 a New favorites don't retain the channel info in the "edit" view, but it is properly applied to 
   which programs are selected.
 a Favourites that have been imported are not displayed with a heart symbol,
   or added to guide
 a When I create a new favourite it is marked with a heart, but it is not added
   to the list of favourites.  When I exit and restart, the programme is not
   marked with a heart.
 a When an error occurs reading a serialised file, FreeGuide should display an
   error message, and offer to re-download listings in the new format.

   under Options : Advanced : Grabbers

     $ java -jar build/startup.jar
     E02. Main class('freeguide.FreeGuide') not found
     java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: freeguide.FreeGuide

             at freeguide.Startup.main(Startup.java:48)
 a Call System.exit when we leave FreeGuide.  See Joe Blow's email of 01/07/05
 a Make the extra program details appear like they did in 0.8.x
 a Fix inability to change day when using tv-unprocessed.xmltv (does this still
   happen?)
 a When you try to enter a day with no downloaded listings, FreeGuide should
   prompt asking whether you want to download new listings.  At the moment it
   just prevents you from changing to that day.
 a After I have migrated from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2, my favourites are
   listed in the file ~/.java/.userPrefs/org/freeguide-tv/mainController/
   selection/prefs.xml but when I choose "Favourites" in FreeGuide, none are
   listed.
 a List programmes only after NOW in personal guide.
 a New channel sets should have a default name
 a Closing Please Wait dialog should not close FreeGuide except during startup.
 a Options screen: remove unneeded options and make more user-friendly.  Change
   "Viewers:Horizontal" etc node to "Horizontal Viewer" node just below layout,
   with other viewers appearing below.
 a Check whether we need TZ set, and if not, remove warnings about it.
 a Why does the data get loaded 3 times when we start?
 a On Andy's machine the FreeGuide window has no icon in the top left, and the
   Please Wait dialog is missing its image.
 a Make a plugin manager
 a Use serialization to reduce startup time

</pre>
<h3>Release 0.10pre1 (Add some features to plugins-branch work)</h3>
<pre class='escaped'>

 + Make the StripView focussed when you click on a programme
 + Fix Windows install bugs:
     + When you try to configure a grabber (uk_rt), from the First Time Wizard
       or the Options screen, FreeGuide freezes.  When you kill FreeGuide, the
       grabber configuration screen appears.
 a Default country in First Time Wizard appears not to migrate correctly:
   choosing "UK (slower but more detail) results in "Canada" being selected in
   upgrade to 0.10.1.
 a Theme changes from Metal to GTK+ on upgrade.
 a Generate the list of grabber plugins dynamically by asking each plugin what
   countries it supports (XMLTV should make this list by looking at what
   properties files it has available).
 a "Download in background" should work to make the downloading dialog non-modal.
 a Rename classes so every class has a different name.
 a Get rid of System.err.println, either removing, or replacing with 
   FreeGuide.log.info
 a The upgrade from 0.8.6 to 0.10.1 changed my theme from Metal to GTK.  It
   should leave my theme unchanged.
 a Ensure that the HTML personalised guide only shows programmes that are before
   the day start time today and after the day start time tomorrow.
 a Internationalise "Horizontal Viewer" name
 a A currently-chosen browser, or a migrated one, should take priority over
   the default browser names in the properties file.
   How it works: If we migrate from previous version, we use selected browser,
   if we run firsts, then we use DEFAULT browser from properties.
 a Buttons on the XMLTV grabbers Option pane say "Default" and "", when they
   should say "Configure" and "Delete", I think.
 + Channel sets do not appear to work - not sure why, but try using
   tv_grab_uk_bleb and then making a channel set.
 a The default channel set name is "" and it should be "(New channel set)"
 a Options screen:
     a Rename "..." buttons to "Configure"
     a Change "XMLTV" checkbox to "Enable XMLTV plugin"
     a Rename "C" buttons to "Default"
     a Rename "Add" to "Add a new XMLTV grabber"
     a Make a wider gap between XMLTV grabbers so they look separate.
     a Make all panels accessible via keyboard accelerators
     a Allow to specify a default browser (needed by Debian maintainer)
 + Migrate XMLTV settings from 0.8.x
 a Deleting XMLTV grabbers does not work - they re-appear when you re-enter
   Options
 a Can we remove ViewerFramePositionConfig class?
 a "Show output" should change to "Hide output" when it's clicked
 a Merge changes from HEAD into plugins-branch
     a --quiet for all commands
     a src/freeguide/gui/viewer/ChannelJLabel.java 10 pixel minimum width
     a src/freeguide/gui/viewer/ViewerFrameXMLTVLoader.java use the first channel
       name, not all.
 a Support more than one copy of each xmltv grabber
 a Progress bar on Please Wait dialog does not move.

</pre>
<h3>Release 0.10pre0 (Stabilising plugins-branch work)</h3>
<pre class='escaped'>

 + Day start time appears to have no effect on the display of programmes (does it
   need a re-download?)
 + Please Wait dialog appears to have no title.
 a "Remove favourite" english translation appears to be missing
 a When I changed channel set to one that had been imported, it crashed - the
   "Please wait" window appeared, and then it froze.
 a After the above crash all my favourites disappeared
 a When I start downloading for the first time, the "Please wait" window is a
   strange shape (too tall - nearly square).  Then when I choose "show details"
   it becomes very wide, and then when i choose "hide details" it goes back
   to the correct shape.
 a It successfully imported my channel set, but none of the channels were
   recognised, so it was blank.  Have the channel ids changed? 
 + "Go to now" button should be the default, so when you press RETURN it is
   activated
 + Setting for tooltips is not imported.  I had this turned off, and after
   upgrade it is turned on
 + When I upgrade, the window position is correct, and the horizontal splitpane,
   but the vertical splitpane seems to be wrong
 a migration doesn't checked xmltv plugin
 a display message on upgrade wizard if xmltv config exists
 a Personalised guide needs to be refreshed when you select a programme
 a Reminders do not work
 a Add to favourites has disappeared from the right-click menu
 a Print personalised listing menu item does not work
 a Upgrade should copy the old xmltv config file into the new location
 a Upgrade should copy channel sets and all other preferences (e.g. window
   locations)
 a When I did an upgrade from 0.8.6 to 0.10, the first time it started it froze
   with the programmes window visible, but the please wait dialog in front, 
   unpainted - just a grey box the size of the please wait dialog.
 a hide_output is not translated into English.
 a Main window does not refresh after downloading listings.
 a Please wait dialog sometimes appears when you have not changed anything
 a Favourites are not automatically selected
 a Favourites do not display hearts
 a FreeGuide forgets which programmes have been selected when you move off this
   day and back again
 a Sometimes you can't click on programmes - don't know why
 a Java grabbers need to display their errors in the "Show output" section, not
   the command line (we need to catch and handle any exceptions.)

 a Downloading is not working - the download box closes immediately.  It doesn't
   write "Executing system command" to the console.
 a Are the command lines for grabbers now hardcoded?  If so, we need to change
   this into a properties files as before and allow the user to make changes.
 a Day start time in horizontal Options is not migrated?
 a Please Wait screen disappears immediately
 a Clicking "Show Output" during command execution (XMLTV) resizes the dialog
   horizontally as well as vertically
 a Re-sizing the Downloading dialog (XMLTV) causes the output section to become
   very small
 a Doesn't remember vertical or horizontal slider positions on main screen
 a 2 different File menus - one contains Options and Quit, and one Download
   Listings, Print this Personalised ... and a separator
 a Options should be under Tools menu
 a Menus out of order - should be File Tools Help
 a Choosing User Guide from the Help menu gives:
   Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException
         at freeguide.lib.general.Utils.execNoWait(Unknown Source)
 a Choosing "Show README" during First Time Wizard does nothing.
 a Executing command dialog has no entry on the task bar (Linux, Gnome) and
   disappears behind the main screen when you click the main screen's entry.
   (It should be a modal dialogue [actually set from prefs] with the main screen
   as its parent - is it?)
 a stderr in Show output should not be prefixed by "WARNING: " - it is normally
   just for information.
 a Running the First Time Wizard twice leaves you with 2 grabber plugins, whereas
   normally it should replace one with another.  Having 2 is for advanced users.
 a The title of the tree node in Options for grabbers needs to have a friendly
   name.  Currently called 
 a Missing or invalid XML for the today's listings causes FreeGuide to freeze on
   startup with an exception
 a Each grabber plugin should have its own tree node under the plugins node on
   the Options screen.
 a Main screen does not refresh after a download of listings
 a Main screen is empty with everything in bottom right hand corner on startup
 a Listings only displayed when you move away from today and back onto today
   using the date combobox.
 a Command output window should display what commands were executed as well as
   what output there was.
 a Migrate old preferences to new
 a Channels are shorter than programmes
 a Icons are bigger than channel boxes
 a Some channel boxes aren't big enough for the full name
 a Lots of extra files in ~/.freeguide - looks like there may be a missing "/"
   somewhere - files are called e.g. "iconCachechannel4_com".
 a iconcache has been renamed to iconCache
 a Downloading dialog does not close when it is finished, even though the
   "Please Wait" window does appear, so presumably the view is refreshed.
 a Dialog should say "Downloading, please wait" instead of just "Please Wait".
