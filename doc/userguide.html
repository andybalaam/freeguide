<h1>FreeGuide User Guide</h1>

<h2>Running for the first time</h2>

<p>The first time you run FreeGuide it ask you some questions and then offers to configure your grabber.  If you're on Windows or you're using the modified XMLTV on Linux, tick the box, but otherwise, don't.</p>

<p>If you followed the installation instructions for your platform exactly, but you get an error here, it's a bug - sorry! - <a href="mailto:freeguide-tv-users@lists.sourceforge.net">contact</a> us and we'll sort you out.</p>

<p>If all has gone well, FreeGuide will know what channels you want, but won't be able to show any programmes because you haven't downloaded them yet.  When it starts it will ask you whether you want to go to the download screen.  Connect to the Internet, and click Yes.  Cross your fingers and wait.  If all is well, the listings should eventually download (it can take some time), and you can click OK to start using FreeGuide.  If you have problems have a look at the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Note: if you very quickly get an "Execution Error" message, check that you're connected to the Internet and try again.  If you wait quite a while and then get the "Execution Error" message, everything may still be alright - click "Continue" to see.</p>

<h2>The main screen</h2>

<p>On the main screen time advances from left to right (click "Go To Now" to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below another.</p>

<p>The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can choose a day from the list.</p>

<p>You can click on a programme (making it change colour) to add it to your personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom section of the window.</p>

<p>Clicking "Print this personalised listing" will open up your web browser with your customised TV guide, and you can print it by choosing "File" and then "Print" in your browser.</p>

<p>To change the order of your channels, or only show some of them at a time, use the "Channel Sets" option on the "Tools" menu.  After you've made one, you can choose a channel set with the dropdown list at the top-right of the main screen.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>You can make programmes highlight themselves by adding them to your favourites list (under the "Tools" menu click "Favourites").  Any programme matching a favourite will be ticked automatically.  You can always un-tick programmes if you wish.  You can also make a programme a favourite by right-clicking it and choosing "Add to Favourites".</p>

<p>Check out the "Options" item on the "Tools" menu to customise FreeGuide and alter lots of options.</p>
