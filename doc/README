Introduction

   FreeGuide is a TV guide programme. It uses parser programmes to
   extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing
   without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the
   user to view television listings and create customised TV guides by
   selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.

   It works for UK, US, Canadian, German, Swedish and Norwegian listings,
   and has experimental support for listings for New Zealand.

   FreeGuide is written by the FreeGuide contributors (copyright
   2001-2002). Please do send code, ideas, bugs and comments to
   freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. FreeGuide's home page is at
   http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net. You can contact the lead
   developer, Andy Balaam at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience
   and Robotics (CCNR), University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.

   FreeGuide uses the XMLTV parsers (and file format) developed by the
   very friendly people at XMLTV (http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/ and
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv). It also contains a little code
   by Slava Pestov from the JEdit project (www.jedit.org).

Installing FreeGuide

   FreeGuide is written in Java, and thus should work on most types of
   computer. It is developed and tested on Linux and Windows.

   Windows users should read the Windows installation docs.

   Linux and other Unix-like users should read the Linux installation
   docs.

   Other people should try following the Linux instructions, but note
   that you will definitely need Java 1.4, which may be a problem on Mac
   OS.

Using FreeGuide

   The first time you run FreeGuide it will check that everything is set
   up correctly, and allow you to change things if something's gone
   wrong. If you followed the installation instructions for your platform
   exactly, but you get an error here, it's a bug - sorry! - contact the
   developers and we'll sort you out.

   If all has gone well, FreeGuide will know what channels you want, but
   won't be able to show any programmes because you haven't downloaded
   them yet. When it starts it will ask you whether you want to go to the
   download screen. Connect to the Internet, and click Yes. Cross your
   fingers and wait. If all is well, the listings should eventually
   download (it can take some time), and you can click OK to start using
   FreeGuide. If you've had problems, click "Show Output" and look at
   what's happened. Now you'll need to go to the Options screen and try
   to sort it out. Email if you need help.

   On the main screen time advances from left to right (click "Go To Now"
   to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below another.

   The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can
   choose a day from the list.

   You can click on a programme (making it go grey) to add it to your
   personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom section
   of the window.

   You can make programmes highlight themselves by adding them to your
   favourites list (under the "Tools" menu click "Favourites"). Any
   programme matching a favourite will be ticked automatically. You can
   always un-tick programmes if you wish. You can also make a programme a
   favourite by right-clicking it and choosing "Add to Favourites".

   Clicking "Print this personalised listing" will open up your web
   browser with your customised TV guide, and you can print it by
   choosing "File" and then "Print" in your browser.

   To download more listings, click on "Download Listings".

   Check out the "Tools" menu to customise FreeGuide and alter varius
   options.

Notes

   If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
   because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.
   Check the XMLTV page for updated parsers.

   If FreeGuide won't work for you, why not make it work? If you're
   having trouble, ask us and we'll be glad to help.

   Check out our TODO list.

   Support for New Zealand listings doesn't appear to work as far as I
   can tell, so I'm calling it "experimental". Let me know if you have
   any success with this. I _think_ the grabber provided with XMLTV 0.5.5
   just doesn't work for some reason. If you do use the nz grabber,
   you'll have to leave the preference setting for grabber config file
   location as %home%/.xmltv/tv_grab_nz since the grabber is unable to
   use a file in a different location.

   If you use the North American grabber on Linux it will never overwrite
   listings files that already exist without giving you a choice. If you
   want it to overwrite a particular file, delete it from
   ~/.freeguide-tv/.

   If you grab some listings late in a day, nearing the grabber's idea of
   the end of a day (e.g. close to 6am for the UK grabber) then you may
   be told that there are missing listings for that day even though
   you've just grabbed new listings. This is because the grabbing has
   started from tomorrow, so what's left of today doesn't have a full set
   of listings. Don't worry about this - just say "No" and you should be
   able to see what you need.

   If you install the Windows version and choose UK as your region, and
   then uninstall FreeGuide at a later date, some files will not be
   removed from C:\Perl\share\xmltv. You may remove them manually if you
   like.
