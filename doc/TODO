below them are completed.

This document is at risk of radical change whenever I

--------------------------------------------

- Wish list (I have no plans to implement, but contributions are welcome)

- Think about ports to Gnome, wxPython, ...
- Convert to SWT (or SwingWT?) and compile natively with GCJ?
- Process programmes in another thread so we can see a progress display.
- Apply different fonts to every screen?
- Review usefulness of stuff like ConfigGuesser
- Change all forms to use GridBagEasy and newXXX methods.
- Sort out Utils.exec methods so they make sense
+ Separate classes into packages
- Reduce the size of the XMLTV exe by removing unnecessary Tk files
- Package XMLTV using PAR

	uninstalled (well, you have to delete the directory instead...)

	which need to be scanned on startup (in fact that is a better way to do
	it in even if we stick with choices.).
