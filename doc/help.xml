	  <!--The radio stations have disappeared since we changed the default listings provider over to the Radio Times instead of bleb.org.  We did this because bleb started limiting all downloads to 10 channels or less.

If you'd like to go back to add bleb as well as Radio Times, go to the Tools menu, choose Options, open the Advanced node, then Grabbers, and click XMLTV.  Now click "Add a new XMLTV grabber" in the top right, and from the blank drop-down choose "uk_bleb".  Now click "Configure" above and choose your radio stations (the TV stations will still be downloaded via Radio Times, so you don't need to choose them).  Click OK to save your changes.-->

            <answer>
              <para>If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it
              is probably because the web site it grabs listings from has
              changed its format. Check the whether there is a <ulink

            <question>
              <para>How do I completely uninstall FreeGuide on Windows?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>You can uninstall FreeGuide on Windows by going to the
              "Add/Remove Programs" screen in the Control Panel.  That should
              be all you need to do.</para>

              <para>However, uninstalling FreeGuide leaves your settings
              (such as favourites, colours etc.) on your computer.  Often,
              this is useful, since if you ever re-install FreeGuide it will
              already be set up for you, but sometimes you might want to
              delete these settings, for example if something has gone
              wrong and you want to start again from scratch, or if you
              just don't like programs leaving stuff all over your
              computer.</para>

              <para>To remove the FreeGuide settings from the Windows registry,
              follow these instructions:</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Now press F3 on the keyboard to find any other

              <para>If your grabber fails to configure or run because it can't

              <para>If you grab some listings late in a day, nearing the
              grabber's idea of the end of a day (e.g. close to 6am for the UK
              grabber) then you may be told that there are missing listings
              for that day even though you've just grabbed new listings. This
              is because the grabbing has started from tomorrow, so what's
              left of today doesn't have a full set of listings. Don't worry
              about this - just say "<guibutton>No</guibutton>" and you should

            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>If FreeGuide is not working or acting strangely, you
              should contact the developers - see How do I ask more
              questions?. When you do contact the mailing lists, it would be
              useful to know various pieces of information.</para>

              <para>You should find out your operating system (e.g
              <productname>Windows XP</productname>), the version of
              <productname>Java</productname> you are using, and the version
              of FreeGuide. Linux users should also check theit XMLTV
              version.</para>

              <para>If you are having problems downloading, the first useful
              piece of information is the contents of the "Show details"
              window. Copy and paste the information in there into your
              email.</para>

              <para>If you are having more complex problems, the developers
              may ask you to try running FreeGuide from within a DOS or Cmd
              Window. Here is how to do that in Windows:</para>

              <para>From the <guibutton>Start menu</guibutton> choose
              <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>, <guimenu>Accessories</guimenu> and

              "<guimenuitem>DOS Window</guimenuitem>".</para>

              <programlisting>cd "C:\Program Files\FreeGuide" &lt;PRESS RETURN&gt;
java -jar startup.jar &gt; log.txt &lt;PRESS RETURN&gt;</programlisting>

              <para>Now copy and paste the contents of <filename>C:\Program

            <question>
              <para>How can I make FreeGuide download more than 1 weeks' XMLTV
              listings at a time?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>Go to the "Tools" menu and choose "Options".  Open the "Advanced"
              node and open the "Grabbers" node, and choose "XMLTV".  In the lower
              text box is the command used to run the XMLTV grabber.  It starts
              something like this:</para>
              <programlisting>"%xmltv_path%/xmltv.exe" tv_grab_uk_rt</programlisting>
              <para>(The uk_rt bit will be different if you are not in the UK.)
              After this bit are the other bits of the command, e.g. "--quiet",
              "--config-file" etc.  If you add the string " --days 14 " after
              the main command (shown above) and before the other options (e.g.
              "--quiet") this will tell XMLTV to download 14 days instead of the
              default of 7.</para>
              <para>If something gets messed up and listings won't download, click the
              button labelled "Default" to get the old command back.</para>
              <para>Note that some of the listings sources do not provide listings for
              such a long time into the future, and some of the XMLTV grabbers for
              some countries do not listen to the --days option, so this change may
              not make any difference for some people.</para>

              retrieve listings?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>You can't, at least not with freeguide.  You can use
              XMLTV to download the listings for freeguide to use.</para>
              <para>Essentially, you'll use the XMLTV grabber to retrieve
              the listings and redirect to an .xmltv file in the freeguide
              directory.  The next time you start freeguide, the new
              listings will be read in.</para>
              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>First, figure out exactly what the xmltv grabber
                  command is.  Under 'options', 'advanced', you can
                  highlight the 'xmltv' grabber and see the command that's

                  directory under a sub-directory called xmltv-configs.

            <answer>

              then i just went into tools, options, advanced,grabbers,xmltv, picked
              any one and changed the command path to
              C:\Program Files\video\FreeGuide\TVGuideGrabber\tv_grab_au_tuhs.exe --config-file "C:\Program Files\video\FreeGuide\TVGuideGrabber\tv_grab_au_tuhs.xml"

              <para>If you manage to get any non-official grabbers working, let us
              know on the developers' mailing list so we can help others do the same.
              If any third-party grabber works well, and is not going to go into
              XMLTV for some reason (e.g. it's not written in Perl),and it's GPL
              licenced, we will consider distributing it as a part of FreeGuide
              to make it easier for others to use.</para>

            <question>
              <para>FreeGuide doesn't list the look-and-feel I installed - how
              do I use it?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>If you have installed a look-and-feel that FreeGuide was
              unable to identify, you may type its class name into the combo
              box in the General section of the Options screen.
              Note that you must provide the fully-qualified classname - one
              that includes several words separated by periods, such as
              <filename>javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel</filename>.
              The fully qualified classname should be given in the
              look-and-feel's documentation.</para>

              <para>If you type in the class name and nothing happens,
              FreeGuide is unable to find the specified class. Make sure you
              spelled the class name correctly. If everything is spelled
              correctly, make sure you installed the look-and-feel
              correctly.</para>

            <question>
              <para>How do I change my GTK theme?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>If you're using a Unix-like operating system, use the tool
              provided by your distribution vendor to install and select the
              theme. Now, simply start FreeGuide and, if you haven't already
              done so, select the GTK+ look-and-feel and enjoy the new look. In
              general, themes are installed by extracting their files into the
              <filename>${USER}/.themes</filename> directory. If you do not
              have a tool for working with GTK+ themes, <ulink
              url="http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts">GTK Theme Switch
              2</ulink> is a nice lightweight program for installing and
              selecting themes. Note: If you do not want to install and/or
              select the theme, you may follow the Windows instructions
              below.</para>

              <para>If you're using Windows (or you don't want to install the
              theme on your Unix-like operating system), it's not necessary to
              install the theme. Extract the theme files to a directory,
              keeping each theme in its own directory, and keep all the theme
              directories together in a single directory to make them easy to
              find (I recommend using <filename>C:\gtk</filename> since it's
              short and easy to type).</para>

              <para>Since most of the themes will be distributed in "tarballs"
              (a common way to distribute software for Unix-like operating
              systems), you will need an extraction tool that can handle tape
              archive files (tar files) and GZIP and/or BZIP2 compression. One
              such tool for Windows is <ulink
              url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</ulink>.</para>

              <para>Once you've extracted the themes, you're ready to use
              them. To do so, just specify the location of the
              <filename>gtkrc</filename> file in the
              <filename>swing.gtkthemefile</filename> system property on the
              command line, as shown below:</para>

              <programlisting>java -Dswing.gtkthemefile="C:\gtk\Theme Name\gtk-2.0\gtkrc" ...</programlisting>

              <para>Where "..." means fill in the rest of the shortcut command
              that was already present.</para>
