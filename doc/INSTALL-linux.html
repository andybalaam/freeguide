<h1>FreeGuide INSTALL-linux</h1>

<p>These are Linux installation instructions.  For Windows installation instructions see <a href="INSTALL-windows.html">INSTALL-windows.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To use FreeGuide you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">Java 2 Runtime Environment</a> version 1.4 or above.  You can check this by typing <tt>java -version</tt> in a command-line window.  (If you've installed the new version of Java but "java -version" still says the old one, you need to look at putting the new version of java in your PATH.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39046">XMLTV</a> package version 0.5.14 or above.  This in turn needs <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Perl</a> (which almost everyone already has).  XMLTV is a little tricky to install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from CPAN.  You only need to install the grabber for your region (tv_grab_** where ** is the code for your country e.g. uk for UK, na for North America).  Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end.  Help is always available from <a href="mailto:xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.  Once you've got XMLTV installed, the rest is easy.</li>
<li>NOTE: If you are upgrading from XMLTV 0.5.8 or earlier you will need to rename your grabber configuration file (in ~/.xmltv) to end in .conf (e.g. tv_grab_uk.conf).</li>
<!-- no longer needed!
<li>If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution you got, you need to download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide download site</a> and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually /usr/bin/).  Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV distribution soon.  You may also need to do <tt>chmod a+x /usr/bin/tv_split</tt> to make it executable.</li>
-->
</ul>

<p>After installing XMLTV, you need to configure it.  Connect to the Internet before doing this.  UK people should type (at a command prompt):</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_uk --configure</tt></p>
<p>and US and Canadian people should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_na --configure</tt></p>
<p>and Swedish and Norwegian people should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_sn --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from New Zealand should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_nz --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from Finland should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_fi --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from Italy should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_it --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from Spain should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_es --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from the Netherlands should type (you may get some errors, but it should work):</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_nl --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from Denmark should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_dk --configure</tt></p>
<p>people from Hundary should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_hu --configure</tt></p>

<p>Follow the instructions to configure your grabber.</p>
<p>German people don't need to do perform this step, lucky them!</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>When XMLTV is installed and configured, download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide-xx-Linux-Install</a> jar file and run it with <tt>java -jar FreeGuide-xx-Linux-Install.jar</tt>.  This will install FreeGuide in a directory of your choice.</p>

<p>You can now run FreeGuide by typing:</p>
<p><tt>cd ~/freeguide-tv</tt> (adapt if you installed it elsewhere)<br>
<tt>java -jar FreeGuide.jar</tt></p>

<p>If you've used the default options everywhere, it should just work.</p>

<p>See the <a href="README.html">README</a> for info on how to use FreeGuide.</p>
