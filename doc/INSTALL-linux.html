<h1>FreeGuide INSTALL-linux</h1>

<p>These are Linux installation instructions.  For Windows installation instructions see <a href="INSTALL-windows.html">INSTALL-windows.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To use FreeGuide you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2 Runtime Environment</a> version 1.4 or above.  You can check this by typing <tt>java -version</tt> in a command-line window.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39046">XMLTV</a> package version 0.5 or above.  This in turn needs <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Perl</a> (which almost everyone already has).  XMLTV is a little tricky to install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from CPAN.  Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end (Hint: some versions need Sort::Versions as well as the prerequisites listed on the site).  Help is always available from <a href="mailto:xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.  Once you've got XMLTV installed, the rest is easy.</li>
<li>If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution you got, you need to download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide download site</a> and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually /usr/bin/).  Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV distribution soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing XMLTV, you need to configure it.  Connect to the Internet before doing this.  UK people should type (at a command prompt):</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_uk --configure</tt></p>
<p>and US and Canadian people should type:</p>
<p><tt>tv_grab_na --configure</tt></p>
<p>Follow the instructions to configure your grabber.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>When XMLTV is installed and configured, download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install</a> jar file for your region (UK for the UK or NA for North America) and run it with <tt>java -jar FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install.jar</tt>.  This will install FreeGuide in a directory of your choice..</p>

<p>You can now run FreeGuide by typing:</p>
<p><tt>cd ~/freeguide-tv</tt> (adapt if you installed it elsewhere)<br>
<tt>java -jar FreeGuide.jar</tt></p>

<p>If you've used the default options everywhere, it should just work.</p>

<p>See the <a href="README.html">README</a> for info on how to use FreeGuide.</p>
