<h1>FreeGuide Developers' Page</h1>

<p>This is a small page that should expand over time.</p>

<h2>Attitude</h2>

<p>I (Andy Balaam) am open to contributions from anyone and I expect to accept most patches I receive, except ones that differ radically from my stated aim of creating a nice, simple TV guide.</p>

<h2>Development Language</h2>

<p>FreeGuide itself is written entirely in Java (1.4 required), but it uses the XMLTV tools (XMLTV is a separate project) which are written in Perl.</p>

<h2>What are those .form files?</h2>

<p>Some of FreeGuide's forms were originally created using NetBeans, and the .form files are NetBeans' XML GUI format.  However, as the forms are increasingly dynamic in design, this approach is unsuitable, and the more complex GUI stuff is hand-coded.  In summary: use NetBeans if you like, but if someone submits a decent patch to some form code by hand-altering the .java file, I'll accept it and abandon the .form file for that form.</p>

<h2>Help and questions</h2>

<p>Email any questions to <a href="mailto:freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a> and we'll do our best to answer them, and put useful answers up on this page.</p>
