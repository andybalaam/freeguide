   These are Linux installation instructions. For Windows installation
   instructions see INSTALL-windows.html.

Prerequisites

   To use FreeGuide you need:
     * The Java 2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or above. You can check
       this by typing java -version in a command-line window.
     * The XMLTV package version 0.5 or above. This in turn needs Perl
       (which almost everyone already has). XMLTV is a little tricky to
       install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from CPAN.
       Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README that
       comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end (Hint: some
       versions need Sort::Versions as well as the prerequisites listed
       on the site). Help is always available from
       xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. Once you've got XMLTV
       installed, the rest is easy.
     * If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution
       you got, you need to download it from the FreeGuide download site
       and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually
       /usr/bin/). Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV
       distribution soon. You may also need to do chmod a+x
       /usr/bin/tv_split to make it executable.

   After installing XMLTV, you need to configure it. Connect to the
   Internet before doing this. UK people should type (at a command
   prompt):

   tv_grab_uk --configure

   and US and Canadian people should type:

   tv_grab_na --configure

   Follow the instructions to configure your grabber.

   Note for UK users: don't use the regional analogue TV settings.
   Instead, say no to the various options and then at the end name each
   channel you want individually. FreeGuide doesn't support the regional
   way of working as it needs to know the name of each channel
   explicitly.

Installation

   When XMLTV is installed and configured, download the
   FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install jar file for your region (UK for the UK or
   NA for North America) and run it with java -jar
   FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install.jar. This will install FreeGuide in a
   directory of your choice..

   You can now run FreeGuide by typing:

   cd ~/freeguide-tv (adapt if you installed it elsewhere)
   java -jar FreeGuide.jar

   If you've used the default options everywhere, it should just work.

   See the README for info on how to use FreeGuide.
