                          FreeGuide 0.4 INSTALL-linux

   These are Linux installation instructions. For Windows installation
   instructions see [1]INSTALL-windows.html.

Prerequisites

   To use FreeGuide you need:
     * The [2]Java 2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or above. You can
       check this by typing java -version in a command-line window.
     * The [3]XMLTV package version 0.5 or above. This in turn needs
       [4]Perl (which almost everyone already has). XMLTV is a little
       tricky to install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from
       CPAN. Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README
       that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end. Help is
       always available from [5]xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. Once
       you've got XMLTV installed, the rest is easy.
     * If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution
       you got, you need to download it from the [6]FreeGuide download
       site and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually
       /usr/bin/). Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV
       distribution soon.

   After installing XMLTV, you need to configure it. Connect to the
   Internet before doing this. UK people should type (at a command
   prompt):

   tv_grab_uk --configure

   and US and Canadian people should type:

   tv_grab_na --configure

   Follow the instructions to configure your grabber.

Installation

   When XMLTV is installed and configured, download the
   [7]FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install jar file for your region (UK for the UK
   or NA for North America) and run it with java -jar
   FreeGuide-Linux-xx-Install.jar. This will install FreeGuide in a
   directory of your choice..

   You can now run FreeGuide by typing:

   cd ~/freeguide-tv (adapt if you installed it elsewhere)
   java -jar FreeGuide.jar

   If you've used the default options everywhere, it should just work.

   See the [8]README for info on how to use FreeGuide.

   If you have any problems, [9]contact us and we'll sort you out.
