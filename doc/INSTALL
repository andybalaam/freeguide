   These are Linux installation instructions. For Windows installation
   instructions see INSTALL-windows.html.

Prerequisites

   To use FreeGuide you need:
     * The Java 2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or above. You can check
       this by typing java -version in a command-line window.
     * The XMLTV package version 0.5.5 or above. This in turn needs Perl
       (which almost everyone already has). XMLTV is a little tricky to
       install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from CPAN. You
       only need to install the grabber for your region (tv_grab_** where
       ** is the code for your country e.g. uk for UK, na for North
       America). Persevere with this, using the instructions in the
       README that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end.
       Help is always available from xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
       Once you've got XMLTV installed, the rest is easy.

   After installing XMLTV, you need to configure it. Connect to the
   Internet before doing this. UK people should type (at a command
   prompt):

   tv_grab_uk --configure

   and US and Canadian people should type:

   tv_grab_na --configure

   and Swedish and Norwegian people should type:

   tv_grab_sn --configure

   people from New Zealand should type:

   tv_grab_nz --configure

   Follow the instructions to configure your grabber.

   German people don't need to do perform this step, lucky them!

Installation

   When XMLTV is installed and configured, download the
   FreeGuide-xx-Linux-Install jar file for your region (UK for the UK or
   NA for North America) and run it with java -jar
   FreeGuide-xx-Linux-Install.jar. This will install FreeGuide in a
   directory of your choice..

   You can now run FreeGuide by typing:

   cd ~/freeguide-tv (adapt if you installed it elsewhere)
   java -jar FreeGuide.jar

   If you've used the default options everywhere, it should just work.

   See the README for info on how to use FreeGuide.
