Write out the entire set of preferences FreeGuide is using, and exit.  The preferences are written to the current directory into a file called prefs_cur-VERSION.txt where VERSION is the current version of FreeGuide.  Additionally, if a migration is needed to update FreeGuide's preferences, several more files are written, with names like prefs_old-VERSION.txt and prefs_new-VERSION.txt.  These reflect the preferences stored before and after each stage of the migration process.
