# There isn't a clear definition of what channels belong here: it's
# mostly those with a 'national' identity whether in their home nation
# or aimed at expatriate communities.
#
# Note that merely being based outside the UK or broadcasting in
# languages other than English or Welsh is not enough; for example the
# German SAT.1 channel is classed as 'entertainment'.
