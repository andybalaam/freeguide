# Channels which for no good reason are restricted to certain
# countries.  I'm sure it's possible somehow to pick up all the
# different regional variants on your set-top box, but adding all of
# these to 'gratis' would be excessive since so many of the programmes
# would be the same as plain BBC1 and BBC2.
#
# Note that channels like S4C and Irish channels are not included
# here, since those have a real reason for being and aren't just
# pointless regionalizations of existing channels.
