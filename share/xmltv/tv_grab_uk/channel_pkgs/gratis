# Free digital channels.  The terrestrial analogue versions are not
# included here because they come under their own region package (eg
# 'Tyne Tees').  I haven't included BBC1 Ireland, BBC1 Scotland
# etc. because they duplicate plain BBC1 most of the time and aren't
# always available.
#
# Note we do not distinguish between those which are truly
# free-to-air, and those which require a viewing card which is freely
# available (at least within the United Kingdom).  Since this is for
# tv_grab_uk and not some tv_grab_europe, we don't need to worry.
