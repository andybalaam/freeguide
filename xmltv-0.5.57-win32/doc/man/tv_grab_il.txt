DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many channels available in
    Israel. The data comes from tv.walla.co.il.

    First you must run tv_grab_il --configure to choose which channels you
    want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_il with no arguments will get a listings in XML
    format for the channels you chose for available days including today.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which channels to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_il.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than all available days.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see
    <http://membled.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmltvCapabilities>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.
