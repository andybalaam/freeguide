Introduction

   FreeGuide is an TV guide programme. It uses parser programmes to
   extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing
   without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the
   user to view television listings and create customised TV guides by
   selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.

   For the moment, it works for UK and North American listings, but
   contributions are welcome, especially in the area of getting the
   German listings grabber tv_grab_de to play nicely with FreeGuide.

   FreeGuide is written by the [6]FreeGuide contributors (copyright
   2001-2002). Please do send code, ideas, bugs and comments to
   [7]freeguide-tv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. FreeGuide's home page is
   at [8]http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net. You can contact the lead
   developer, Andy Balaam at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience
   and Robotics (CCNR), University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.

   FreeGuide uses the XMLTV format and parsers developed by the very
   friendly people at XMLTV
   ([9]http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/ and
   [10]http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv). It also contains a little
   code by Slava Pestov from the JEdit project ([11]www.jedit.org).

Installing FreeGuide

   FreeGuide is written in Java, and thus should work on most types of
   computer. It is developed and tested on Linux, and is intended to work
   on Windows, although it is still tricky to set up on Windows at the
   moment.

   Windows users should read the [13]Windows installation docs.

   Linux and other Unix-like users should read the [14]Linux installation
   docs.

Using FreeGuide

   The first time you run FreeGuide it will run its configuration wizard
   which will check that everything is set up correctly, and allow you to
   change things if you've installed it in a nonstandard way. If you
   followed the installation instructions for your platform exactly, but
   you get an error in this wizard, it's a bug: sorry - [15]contact the
   developers and we'll sort you out.

   Once you're past the setup wizard you will enter the main screen. If
   all has gone well, FreeGuide will know what channels you want, but
   won't be able to show any programmes because you haven't downloaded
   them yet. It will ask you whether you want to go to the download
   screen. Connect to the Internet, and click Yes. Cross your fingers. If
   all is well, the listings should eventually download, and you can
   click OK to start using FreeGuide. If you've had problems, click "Show
   Output" and look at what's happened. Now you'll need to go to the
   Options screen and try to sort it out. [16]Email if you need help.

   On the main screen time advances from left to right (click "Go To Now"
   to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below another.

   The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can
   choose a day from the list.

   You can click on a programme (making it go grey) to add it to your
   personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom section
   of the window.

   You can make programmes be ticked automatically by adding them to your
   favourites list (choose the "Actions" menu and then "Choose
   Favourites"). Any programme matching a favourite will be ticked
   automatically. You can always un-tick programmes if you wish. You can
   also make a programme a favourite by right-clicking it and choosing
   "Add to Favourites".

   Clicking "Print this personalised listing" will open up your web
   browser with your customised TV guide, and you can print it by
   choosing "File" and then "Print" in your browser.

   To download more listings, choose "Actions" and then "Download
   Listings".

   Check out the "Options" menu to alter channels, colours and settings..

Notes

   If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
   because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.
   Check the XMLTV page for updated parsers.

   If FreeGuide won't work for you, why not make it work? If you're
   having trouble, ask me and I'll be glad to help.
