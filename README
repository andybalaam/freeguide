Introduction

   Please note that this readme is out of date since I have removed the
   uktvguide parser from the 0.1 release due to a possible legal problem.
   A new release using a different parser will be available soon.

   FreeGuide is an offline TV listings programme. It uses parser
   programmes to extract TV information from web pages and stores them
   for viewing without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer
   allows the user to view television listings and create customised TV
   guides by selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.
   For the moment, it only does UK listings, but it is designed to make
   it very easy to add other countries.

   FreeGuide is copyright ©2001 by Andy Balaam.  Please do send ideas,
   bugs and comments to me at [9]freeguide@artificialworlds.net. I
   welcome contributions from others. FreeGuide's home page is at
   [10]http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net. You can contact me at 1
   Winkfield Court, Boltro Road, Haywards Heath, United Kingdom, RH16
   1BH.

   FreeGuide uses (a small subset of) the XMLTV format developed by the
   very friendly people at XMLTV ([11]
   http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/ and
   [12]http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv ). In theory, FreeGuide
   should be able to work with the XMLTV grabbers as parsers, but this
   hasn't quite happened yet.  Again, any help would be greatly
   appreciated.

Installing FreeGuide

   Please note that v0.1 is an alpha version and thus: a) may not work
   and b) is slightly fiddly to install.

  Windows Users

   Version 0.1 of FreeGuide is written using Java and Perl, which has all
   kinds of advantages, but means that you may need to do some work to
   get it going. One day I'll write a version that's much easier to
   install and use. If you email me and tell me you like the program,
   I'll be encouraged and work faster.

   For now, follow these instructions, and email me if you get stuck.

    1. Install Java

   The first thing you need to do is install the Java 2 Runtime
   Enviroment (JRE).  If you've already got Java installed, it might be
   version 1, rather than version 2, which is no good.  You can check
   this by typing...
java -version

   ...in an MS-DOS window.  If you haven't got Java installed, or you've
   got version 1 instead of version 2, you need to go to
   [14]http://java.sun.com/j2se/ and download it. You'll need the Java 2
   Runtime Environment. At the time of writing version 1.4 is still in
   beta, so I'd recommend you get version 1.3.  However, when 1.4 is
   finished, that will make the next step unnecesary.  Download the Java
   installer, run it, and follow the instructions to install Java on your
   system.

    2. Get an XML Parser

   Once you've got Java, you'll need an XML parser for it.  Here's where
   you'll be glad if you got version 1.4, because it has an XML parser
   built in, and you don't need to do anything.  If you've got 1.3,
   though you'll need to go to
   [15]http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson/crimson-1.1.3-bin.zip and
   download the crimson XML parser.  (For more information about Crimson,
   or if the link doesn't work, go to
   [16]http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html ).  When you unzip this
   file, the file you'll be interested in is called crimson.jar.  More
   about what to do with that later.

    3. Install Perl

   Now you need to get hold of a distribution of Perl from the folks at
   Activestate.  This can be obtained by going to
   [17]http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePer
   l where you'll need to follow the relevant links to make sure your
   system has everything required, before clicking "next" to download
   Activestate Perl.  Run the installer, and follow the instructions.
   Make sure you put Perl in your path, so that you can run it by just
   typing perl in an MS_DOS window. (Note: if this works, typing perl
   (RETURN) will not appear to do much, because perl waits for you to
   give it commands.  However, if this hasn't worked, you'll know,
   because DOS will respond with "Bad command or file name.")

    4. Install FreeGuide

   Download the FreeGuide Java binary uk zip file from
   [18]http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv and save it
   somewhere.  Now create a folder in "C:\Program Files" called
   "FreeGuide".  Note: if you can't make a folder in your "C:\Program
   Files" folder, FreeGuide can be placed in another location, but you'll
   have to alter the config file and the shortcut file accordingly to
   make everything point to the new location.

   If you have a Java 2 version that is less than 1.3, follow the
   instructions labelled "With Crimson".  If you have Java 2 version 1.4,
   or you have an XML Parser in your classpath, follow the instructions
   labelled "Without Crimson".

   With Crimson: Copy the file crimson.jar, which was one of the files
   that was zipped up in the Crimson file, and put in into this folder:
   "C:\Program Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\viewers\java2\".  Copy
   the shortcut "C:\Program
   Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\freeguide-with-crimson.lnk" to your
   desktop, and you should be able to start FreeGuide by double-clicking
   on this.

   Without Crimson: Copy the shortcut "C:\Program
   Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\freeguide-no-crimson.lnk" to your
   desktop, and you should be able to start FreeGuide by double-clicking
   on this.

   You have now installed FreeGuide!  Follow the instructions in
   "Running" below to get it working.

  Linux Users

   Make sure you have the Java 2 Runtime Environment (from
   [19]http://java.sun.com/j2se/ ). You can check this with java
   -version.  If you've got version 1.4 you've already got XML support,
   but otherwise you'll have to get Crimson from
   [20]http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html . If you can work it out,
   put crimson.jar in your classpath, but I couldn't do this, so I put it
   in my freeguide dir as explained below.

   Most linux users will have Perl, but if you haven't, you'll need to
   install it.  Any fairly recent version should work, I think.

   Unzip the FreeGuide Java binary uk file from
   [21]http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv into a directory
   e.g. a subdirectory of your home directory.  I've got mine in
   /home/andy/freeguide-tv, so you'll need to alter the config file to
   reflect where you've put yours. I'll refer to this directory as
   %FREEGUIDEDIR% .

   Now you'll need to alter the config file. Copy the file .freeguide
   from %FREEGUIDEDIR% to your home directory.  Now open a terminal and
   go to your home directory.  Type:
replace /home/andy/freeguide-tv %FREEGUIDEDIR% -- ~/.freeguide

   For example, my mate dave installed freeguide into a directory in his
   home directory called ThisTVGuideThing so he typed:
replace /home/andy/freeguide-tv /home/dave/ThisTVGuideThing -- ~/.freeguide

   If you want to, you can alter the config file manually (the replace
   command just changes every instance of "/home/andy/freeguide-tv" to
   "/home/dave/ThisTVGuideThing"), but be careful not to alter any line
   breaks or blank lines - they all mean something!  Your config file is
   now ready for you.

   If you have a Java 2 version that is less than 1.3, and you haven't
   put Crimson in your classpath, follow the instructions labelled "With
   Crimson".  If you have Java 2 version 1.4, or you have an XML Parser
   in your classpath, follow the instructions labelled "Without Crimson".

   With Crimson: Copy the file crimson.jar from the Crimson zip file into
   the directory %FREEGUIDEDIR%/org/freeguide-tv/viewers/java2/ . You can
   now start freeguide by cd-ing into this directory and typing:
java -classpath crimson.jar:FreeGuide.jar FreeGuide --config-file ~/.freeguide

   Without Crimson: You can start freeguide by cd-ing into the
   %FREEGUIDEDIR%/org/freeguide-tv/viewers/java2/ directory and typing:
java -jar FreeGuide.jar --config-file ~/.freeguide

   You have now installed FreeGuide!  Of course, you may wish to make
   yourself a shell script to start it, and make some shortcuts for your
   desktop, but I'll leave this up to you. Follow the instructions in
   "Running" below to get it working.

  Other Operating Systems

   FreeGuide should work with your operating system if there are Java 2
   and Perl interpreters for it, but I don't have any other systems so I
   can't test it or give detailed instructions.  The Linux instructions
   will be extremely relevant to other *nix OS users, and may be useful
   to others too.

Running FreeGuide

   The first time you run FreeGuide you will be confronted with the
   download screen, because no programmes have been downloaded.  Click on
   "Options" to choose your channels.  In the list box on the Options
   screen you may choose your required channels by clicking on them while
   holding down the Ctrl button on the keyboard.  You'll notice that some
   channels are already selected - these are some ones I watch. You can
   start with these if you like, or get rid of them all by clicking on a
   channel without using Ctrl, and then carrying on with Ctrl held down.
   When you have finished choosing your channels, click "OK".  Make sure
   you're connected to the Internet, and then click on "Download...".

   After a short wait, you should see today's listings of the channels
   you selected.  On this screen time advances from left to right (click
   "Go To Now" to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one
   below another.

   The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can
   choose a day from the list.

   You can click the tick box at the top left corner of a programme to
   add it to your personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the
   bottom section of the window.

   You can make programmes be ticked automatically by adding them to your
   favourites list (choose the "Tools" menu and then "Favourites").  Any
   programme whose title contains some text matching a favourite will be
   ticked automatically.  You can always un-tick programmes if you wish.

   Clicking "Print Listing" will open up your web browser with your
   customised TV guide, and you can print it from there by choosing
   "File" and then "Print".

   To change various options choose the "Tools" menu and then "Options".
    To download more listings, choose "Tools" and then "Download
   Listings" (FreeGuide will take you to this screen automatically when
   you run out of listings).

   Please note that v0.1 does not delete old listings files, so you may
   wish to remove then from the data directory ("C:\Program
   Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\data\") if they are filling up you
   hard disk.

Notes

   There are lots of things you can fiddle with on the Advanced and View
   tabs of the Options screen.  I haven't bothered to document them here
   because they are intended primarily to be set up before distribution.
   What I mean is that they give me the flexibility to distribute viewers
   with different parsers etc. without the need to recompile or alter the
   program.

   There are some bugs in this release, most notably the strange fast
   scrolling behaviour that happens when you re-enter the listings view
   screen from somewhere else (or when you change the day). Any advice,
   help or code on this problem would be gratefully received. Other bugs
   include generally not dealing well with unexpected things, and
   doubtless many things I don't know about.

   If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
   because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.
   Check back at [22]http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv for
   updated parsers.

   My immediate plans are to make one more Java version with a proper
   installer that make lifes very easy, especially for Windows users.
   However, the Java/Perl setup is really a prototype for a final
   version, which I hope to write in C++ using wxWindows. This version
   will have standard easy installation and will allow seamless
   downloading of new parsers when required. The first thing I need to do
   for this is learn C++, so don't hold your breath.  Again, any help
   appreciated.
