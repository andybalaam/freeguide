Introduction

   FreeGuide is an TV guide programme. It uses parser programmes to
   extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing
   without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the
   user to view television listings and create customised TV guides by
   selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.

   For the moment, it works for UK and North American listings, but
   contributions are welcome, especially in the area of getting the
   German listings grabber tv_grab_de to play nicely with FreeGuide.

   So far, all of FreeGuide is by Andy Balaam (copyright 2001-2). Please
   do send code, ideas, bugs and comments to me at
   [6]freeguide@artificialworlds.net. I welcome contributions from
   others. FreeGuide's home page is at
   [7]http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net. You can contact me at the
   Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR), University
   of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.

   FreeGuide uses the XMLTV format and parsers developed by the very
   friendly people at XMLTV
   ([8]http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/ and
   [9]http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv). It also contains a little
   code by Slava Pestov from the Jedit project ([10]www.jedit.org).

Installing FreeGuide

   FreeGuide is written in Java, and thus should work on most types of
   computer. It is developed and tested on Linux, and is intended to work
   on Windows, although it is still tricky to set up on Windows at the
   moment.

   To use FreeGuide you need:
     * The [12]Java 2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or above. You can
       check this by typing java -version in a DOS or command-line
       window.
     * The [13]XMLTV tools. You'll need the version for your platform,
       and non-Windows users will need [14]Perl (which almost everyone
       already has). Windows people should unzip the file into
       "C:\Program Files\xmltv\" if possible.
     * If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution
       you got, you need to download it from the [15]FreeGuide download
       site and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools. Windows
       users need "tv_split.exe", and everyone else needs "tv_split".
       Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV distribution soon.

   When you've got these, download the [16]FreeGuide binary zip and unzip
   it into your home directory. It should make two directories:
   "freeguide-tv" and ".xmltv/freeguide-tv".

   The first thing you need to do is configure your XMLTV grabber.
   Connect to the Internet and open a DOS or terminal window, change to
   the directory containing the XMLTV tools and run your grabber with the
   --configure option. For example, if you live in the UK you should type
   tv_grab_uk --configure, and if you live in North America you should
   type tv_grab_na --configure. Follow the instructions to set up your
   grabber. FreeGuide needs the configuration file generated to know what
   channels you want.

   Now Windows users should be able to run FreeGuide by clicking on the
   "FreeGuide" shortcut in the "freeguide-tv" directory, and everyone
   else should be able to run it by running "runfreeguide.sh" in the
   "freeguide-tv" directory.

Using FreeGuide

   The first time you run FreeGuide it will ask you some questions and
   try to guess how to set itself up using your answers. This works fine
   for me on Linux for UK or North American listings, but is imperfect on
   Windows. Bug fixes for this and anything else will be gratefully
   accepted. If this step doesn't successfully set up your FreeGuide
   installation, you'll need to alter the settings in the "Options"
   screen until it works.

   Once you're past the setup wizard you will enter the main screen. If
   all has gone well, FreeGuide will know what channels you want, but
   won't be able to show any programmes because you haven't downloaded
   them yet. It will ask you whether you want to go to the download
   screen. Say yes, connect to the Internet, and click "Download
   Listings". Cross your fingers. If all is well, the listings should
   eventually download, and you can click OK to start using FreeGuide. If
   you've had problems, click "Details >>" and look at what's happened.
   Now you'll need to go to the Options screen and try to sort it out.
   [17]Email me if you need help.

   On the main screen time advances from left to right (click "Go To Now"
   to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below another.

   The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can
   choose a day from the list.

   You can click on a programme (making it go grey) to add it to your
   personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom section
   of the window.

   You can make programmes be ticked automatically by adding them to your
   favourites list (choose the "Tools" menu and then "Favourites"). Any
   programme matching a favourite will be ticked automatically. You can
   always un-tick programmes if you wish. You can make a programme a
   favourite by right-clicking it and choosing "Add to Favourites".

   Clicking "Print this personalised listing" will open up your web
   browser with your customised TV guide, and you can print it from there
   by choosing "File" and then "Print".

   To change various options choose the "Tools" menu and then "Options".
   To download more listings, choose "Tools" and then "Download
   Listings".

Notes

   If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
   because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.
   Check the XMLTV page for updated parsers.

   If FreeGuide won't work for you, why not make it work? If you're
   having trouble, ask me and I'll be glad to help.
