Introduction

   FreeGuide is an offline TV listings programme. It uses parser
   programmes to extract TV information from web pages and stores them
   for viewing without the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer
   allows the user to view television listings and create customised TV
   guides by selecting programmes and by building up a favourites list.
   For the moment, it only does UK listings, but it is designed to make
   it very easy to add other countries, especially the US and Canada as
   there are XMLTV scripts for these countries already written.

   FreeGuide is copyright ©2001 by Andy Balaam. Please do send ideas,
   bugs and comments to me at [9]freeguide@artificialworlds.net. I
   welcome contributions from others. FreeGuide's home page is at
   [10]http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net. You can contact me at the
   Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR), University
   of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.

   FreeGuide uses the XMLTV format and parsers developed by the very
   friendly people at XMLTV ([11]
   http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/ and
   [12]http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv). All the XMLTV code,
   READMEs and copyright notices may be found in the "xmltv" subdirectory
   of the freeguide programme directory.

   FreeGuide contains a little code by Slava Pestov from the Jedit
   project ([13]www.jedit.org).

   Referring to the crimson XML parser (crimson.jar): This product
   includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation
   (http://www.apache.org/). See the file gui-java/crimsonlicence.txt for
   details.

Installing FreeGuide

   Please note that v0.2 is an alpha version and thus: a) may not work
   and b) is slightly fiddly to install.

  Windows Users

   I'm afraid I haven't been able to get XMLTV working under Windows, but
   if you can, it should be quite easy to get FreeGuide working on top of
   it. Please do let me know if you manage it.

  Linux Users

   Make sure you have the Java 2 Runtime Environment (from
   [15]http://java.sun.com/j2se/). You can check this with java -version.

   Most linux users will have Perl, but if you haven't, you'll need to
   install it.

   Now you need to get all the prerequisites for XMLTV. Follow the
   instructions on the [16]XMLTV page under "Prerequisites". This may
   take some time, and you may need to use "force install" sometimes (I
   don't know why).

   Download the FreeGuide Java binary uk tar.gz file from
   [17]http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv and untar it
   whilst in your home directory.

   Now you'll need to alter the config file. Alter the file
   ~/.freeguide-tv/freeguiderc.txt and replace "/home/andy/freeguide-tv"
   with "/home/yourusername/freeguide-tv" (the "freeguideDirectory"
   entry) and similarly with "/home/andy/.freeguide-tv" (the
   "workingDirectory" entry).

   If you want to, you can alter the rest of the config file manually but
   be careful not to alter any line breaks or blank lines - they all mean
   something! You can alter the configuration from within FreeGuide from
   the Options screen.

   You can now start FreeGuide by running the shell script
   "runfreeguide.sh" in the gui-java subdirectory of the freeguide-tv
   directory. Follow the instructions in "Running" below to get it
   working.

  Other Operating Systems

   FreeGuide should work with your operating system if there are Java 2
   and Perl interpreters for it, but I don't have any other systems so I
   can't test it or give detailed instructions. The Linux instructions
   will be extremely relevant to other *nix OS users, and may be useful
   to others too.

Running FreeGuide

   The first time you run FreeGuide you will need to connect to the
   Internet and then go to the Options screen (from the Tools menu) and
   click "Refresh Channels" to download the names of the channels you can
   get listings for. Please be patient as this may take a while. When the
   channels are downloaded, hold Control on the keyboard and select all
   the channels you want to see listings for. When you have finished,
   click OK and choose Download Listings from the Tools menu. Click Start
   Downloading and wait for the listings to download. When the OK button
   become clickable again, click it, and you should see today's TV
   listings. On this screen time advances from left to right (click "Go
   To Now" to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below
   another.

   The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can
   choose a day from the list.

   You can click the tick box at the top left corner of a programme to
   add it to your personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the
   bottom section of the window.

   You can make programmes be ticked automatically by adding them to your
   favourites list (choose the "Tools" menu and then "Favourites"). Any
   programme whose title contains some text matching a favourite will be
   ticked automatically. You can always un-tick programmes if you wish.

   Clicking "Print Listing" will open up your web browser with your
   customised TV guide, and you can print it from there by choosing
   "File" and then "Print".

   To change various options choose the "Tools" menu and then "Options".
   To download more listings, choose "Tools" and then "Download
   Listings".

   Please note that v0.2 does not delete old listings files, so you may
   wish to remove then from the data directory (".freeguide-tv/data/") if
   they are filling up you hard disk.

Notes

   There are lots of things you can fiddle with on the Advanced and View
   tabs of the Options screen. I haven't bothered to document them here
   because they are intended primarily to be set up before distribution.
   What I mean is that they give me the flexibility to distribute viewers
   with different parsers etc. without the need to recompile or alter the
   program.

   There are some bugs in this release, most notably the strange fast
   scrolling behaviour that happens when you re-enter the listings view
   screen from somewhere else (or when you change the day). Any advice,
   help or code on this problem would be gratefully received. Other bugs
   include generally not dealing well with unexpected things, and
   doubtless many things I don't know about.

   If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
   because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format.
   Check the XMLTV page for updated parsers.

   It should be quite easy to get FreeGuide working with US and Canadian
   listings using the getlistings_na script. The syntax of the download
   and get channels commands in the config file is fairly
   self-explanatory.
