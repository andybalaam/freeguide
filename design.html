<h1>FreeGuide Design Documents</h1>
<p>This is a collection of thoughts about FreeGuide's design.  Contributions, disagreements and comments are <a href="mailto:freeguide@artificialworlds.net">welcome</a>.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>A TV guide is a very simple thing.  In fact, my main reason for writing this application is that TV listings magazines are far, far too complicated for their purposes.  This is brought about partly by the number of adverts and inane articles they contain, and partly because they try to list all the programs everyone wants to see.  FreeGuide attacks this problem on three fronts.  First, it only shows the channels you ask for, second, it highlights programmes you are likely to want to watch, and third, it lets you produce a guide containing only relevant information.</p>
<p>So I want FreeGuide to be a simple thing to use.  That means that any advanced configuration and so on should be in a place where the average user won't find it.</p>

<h2>Example Users</h2>
<h3>Newbie</h3>
<p>My Mum has got the hang of Outlook Express, and uses MS Word slightly tentatively.  She should find it simple to use FreeGuide.  Why not, it's hardly rocket science, is it?</p>

<h3>Hacker</h3>
<p>FreeGuide is listed on Sourceforge, and therefore is likely to get a lot of its initial audience from people who really know what they're doing.  They should be able to do advanced things like grab listings from a different web site, and search programmes powerfully using clever techniques.  However, these abilities should sail past the basic user without being noticed.  Otherwise we disguise the fundamental fact that listing TV programmes is simple.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the hacker who just wants to get the TV listings quickly without learning anything will appreciate simplicity just as much as the newbie.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>In order of frequency of use.</p>
<h3>Viewing listings</h3>
<p>The primary use of FreeGuide is expected to be to look at what's on today, and print off a customised guide.  It should also be easy to have a look at what's on tomorrow, and the rest of the week.</p>

<h3>Downloading listings</h3>
<p>Every week or so the user will need to download new listings, by connecting to the Internet.  This should be almost completely non-interactive, without taking away the user's freedom.</p>

<h3>Downloading channels</h3>
<p>The user will probably only do this once, but it will be the first thing they ever have to do with FreeGuide, so it must be easy, friendly and non-interactive, again not taking away the user's freedom, particularly because they have to connect to the Internet before they begin.</p>

<p>Of course, the user will encounter these tasks in this order: downloading channels, downloading listings, then viewing listings.</p>

<h2>Progress so far</h2>

<h3>0.2</h3>
<p>0.2 retreats slightly from my most strict ease of use requirements, as an acknowledgement that most users will be experts, mainly because it only works under Linux.  It provides lots of unnecessary feedback from its downloading operations, because it is expected to encounter problems that I would like the user to be aware of and report to me.  It also expects you to go to Tools and then Options just to download the listings the first time you use it, which is basically a mistake in the design brought about by a complicated system of checking whether it needs to jump you to here or there got a bit annoying and I took it out.</p>
<p>Hiding Download listings and Options (which allows you to download channels) away in the Tools menu is bad, but it if jumped to the right place automatically when needed, that might be appropriate as the normal user wouldn't need to know where they were.</p>
<p>Installation at the moment is fiddly, because you have to alter the config file manually, and I shall work on installers when there is time.  This isn't a priority at the moment, because there are plenty of bugs to fix and basic UI stuff to be done.</p>
<p>The user doesn't get much feedback that the program is doing something sometimes - the current window disappears, and it can take a while for a new one to appear.</p>

<h3>0.1</h3>
<p>Version 0.1 didn't really work because I had to withdraw the listings grabber, so it didn't satisfy many of the users' requirements.</p>
