	<p>Please note that this readme is out of date since I have removed the uktvguide parser from the 0.1 release due to a possible legal problem.  A new release using a different parser will be available soon.</p>
	</font>
	
<p>FreeGuide is an offline TV listings programme. It uses parser programmes
   to extract TV information from web pages and stores them for viewing without
   the need to connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the user to view
 television  listings and create customised TV guides by selecting programmes
 and by building  up a favourites list. For the moment, it only does UK listings,
  but it is designed to make it very easy to add other countries.</p>
<p>FreeGuide is copyright&nbsp;&copy;2001 by Andy Balaam. &nbsp;Please do
   send ideas, bugs and comments to me at <a href="mailto:freeguide@artificialworlds.net">
      freeguide@artificialworlds.net</a>. I welcome contributions from others. FreeGuide's home page is at 
<a href="http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net">http://freeguide-tv.sourceforge.net</a>. You can contact me at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR), University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK.</p>
<p>FreeGuide uses (a small subset of) the XMLTV format developed by the very
  friendly people at XMLTV (<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/%7Eepa98/work/apps/xmltv/">
    http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/</a>
     and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv</a>
    ). In theory, FreeGuide should be able to work with the XMLTV grabbers
 as  parsers, but this hasn't quite happened yet. &nbsp;Again, any help would
 be greatly appreciated.<br></p>

<h2><a name="installing"></a>
    Installing FreeGuide</h2>
    Please note that v0.1 is an alpha version and thus: a) may not work and 
 b) is slightly fiddly to install.<br>
<h3><a name="installing-windows"></a>
    Windows Users</h3>
<p>Version 0.1 of FreeGuide is written using Java and Perl, which has all
   kinds of advantages, but means that you may need to do some work to get
 it  going. One day I'll write a version that's much easier to install  and
 use. If you email me and tell me you like the program, I'll be encouraged
  and work faster.</p>
<p>For now, follow these instructions, and email me if you get stuck.<br>
</p>
<h4>1. Install Java</h4>
<p>The first thing you need to do is install the Java 2 Runtime Enviroment 
  (JRE). &nbsp;If you've already got Java installed, it might be version 1,
 rather than version 2, which is no good. &nbsp;You can check this by typing...<br>
</p>
<pre>java -version<br></pre>
<p>...in an MS-DOS window. &nbsp;If you haven't got Java installed, or you've 
  got version 1 instead of version 2, you need to go to <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
      and download it. You'll need the Java 2 Runtime Environment. At the 
time   of writing version 1.4 is still in beta, so I'd recommend you get version
  1.3. &nbsp;However, when 1.4 is finished, that will make the <i> next</i>
   step unnecesary. &nbsp;Download the Java installer, run it, and follow
the instructions to install Java on your system.<br>
</p>
<h4>2. Get an XML Parser<br>
</h4>
<p>Once you've got Java, you'll need an XML parser for it. &nbsp;Here's where 
  you'll be glad if you got version 1.4, because it has an XML parser built 
  in, and you don't need to do anything. &nbsp;If you've got 1.3, though you'll
  need to go to <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson/crimson-1.1.3-bin.zip">
     http://xml.apache.org/dist/crimson/crimson-1.1.3-bin.zip</a>
      and download the crimson XML parser. &nbsp;(For more information about
  Crimson, or if the link doesn't work, go to <a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html">
     http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html</a>
     ). &nbsp;When you unzip this file, the file you'll be interested in
is  called  crimson.jar. &nbsp;More about what to do with that later.<br>
</p>
<h4>3. Install Perl</h4>
     Now you need to get hold of a distribution of Perl from the folks  at
 Activestate. &nbsp;This can be obtained by going to <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl">
     http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl</a>
      where you'll need to follow the relevant links to make sure your system 
  has everything required, before clicking "next" to download Activestate 
Perl.  &nbsp;Run the installer, and follow the instructions. Make sure you 
put Perl in your path, so that you can run it by just typing <tt>perl</tt>
   in an MS_DOS window. (Note: if this works, typing <tt>perl (RETURN)</tt>
   will not appear to do much, because perl waits for you to give it commands. 
&nbsp;However, if this hasn't worked, you'll know, because DOS will respond 
with "Bad command or file name.")<br>
<h4>4. Install FreeGuide</h4>
<p> Download the FreeGuide Java binary uk zip file from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv">
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv</a>
     and save it somewhere. &nbsp;Now create a folder in "C:\Program Files" 
 called "FreeGuide". &nbsp;<i>Note: if you can't make a folder in your "C:\Program
  Files" folder, FreeGuide can be placed in another location, but you'll
have   to alter the config file and the shortcut file accordingly to make
everything   point to the new location</i>.</p>
<p>If you have a Java 2 version that is less than 1.3, follow the instructions
  labelled "With Crimson". &nbsp;If you have Java 2 version 1.4, or you have
  an XML Parser in your classpath, follow the instructions labelled "Without
  Crimson".</p>
<p><b>With Crimson</b>: Copy the file crimson.jar, which was one of the files
  that was zipped up in the Crimson file, and put in into this folder: "C:\Program
  Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\viewers\java2\". &nbsp;Copy the shortcut
  "C:\Program Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\freeguide-with-crimson.lnk"
 to your desktop, and you should be able to start FreeGuide by double-clicking
  on this.</p>
<p><b>Without Crimson</b>: Copy the shortcut "C:\Program Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\freeguide-no-crimson.lnk" 
  to your desktop, and you should be able to start FreeGuide by double-clicking 
  on this.</p>
<p>You have now installed FreeGuide! &nbsp;Follow the instructions in "Running"
  below to get it working.</p>
<h3><a name="installing-linux"></a>
    Linux Users</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the Java 2 Runtime Environment (from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
    ). You can check this with <tt>java -version</tt>. &nbsp;If you've got
 version  1.4 you've already got XML support, but otherwise you'll have to
 get Crimson  from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html"> http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html</a>
    . If you can work it out, put crimson.jar in your classpath, but I couldn't
  do this, so I put it in my freeguide dir as explained below.</p>
<p>Most linux users will have Perl, but if you haven't, you'll need to install
  it. &nbsp;Any fairly recent version should work, I think.<br>
</p>
<p>Unzip the FreeGuide Java binary uk file from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv">
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv</a>
     into a directory e.g. a subdirectory of your home directory. &nbsp;I've
  got mine in /home/andy/freeguide-tv, so you'll need to alter the config
file  to reflect where you've put yours. I'll refer to this directory as
<tt>%FREEGUIDEDIR%</tt>   .</p>
<p>Now you'll need to alter the config file. Copy the file <tt>.freeguide</tt>
     from <tt>%FREEGUIDEDIR% </tt>to your home directory. &nbsp;Now open
a  terminal  and go to your home directory. &nbsp;Type:<br>
</p>
<pre>replace /home/andy/freeguide-tv&nbsp;%FREEGUIDEDIR% -- ~/.freeguide<br></pre>
<p>For example, my mate dave installed freeguide into a directory in his
home directory called ThisTVGuideThing so he typed:</p>
<pre>replace /home/andy/freeguide-tv&nbsp;/home/dave/ThisTVGuideThing -- ~/.freeguide<br></pre>
<p>If you want to, you can alter the config file manually (the replace command
  just changes every instance of "/home/andy/freeguide-tv" to "/home/dave/ThisTVGuideThing"),
  but be careful not to alter any line breaks or blank lines - they all mean
  something! &nbsp;Your config file is now ready for you.<br>
</p>
<p>If you have a Java 2 version that is less than 1.3, and you haven't put
  Crimson in your classpath, follow the instructions labelled "With Crimson".
  &nbsp;If you have Java 2 version 1.4, or you have an XML Parser in your
classpath,  follow the instructions labelled "Without Crimson".<br>
</p>
<p><b>With Crimson</b>: Copy the file crimson.jar from the Crimson zip file
  into the directory <tt>%FREEGUIDEDIR%/org/freeguide-tv/viewers/java2/</tt>
    . You can now start freeguide by cd-ing into this directory and typing: 
 </p>
<pre>java -classpath crimson.jar:FreeGuide.jar FreeGuide --config-file ~/.freeguide</pre>
<p><b>Without Crimson</b>: You can start freeguide by cd-ing into the&nbsp;<tt>
    %FREEGUIDEDIR%/org/freeguide-tv/viewers/java2/</tt> directory and typing:
  </p>
<pre>java -jar FreeGuide.jar --config-file ~/.freeguide<br></pre>
<p>You have now installed FreeGuide! &nbsp;Of course, you may wish to make
  yourself a shell script to start it, and make some shortcuts for your desktop,
  but I'll leave this up to you. Follow the instructions in "Running" below
  to get it working.</p>
<h3><a name="installing-other"></a>
    Other Operating Systems</h3>
<p>FreeGuide should work with your operating system if there are Java 2 and
  Perl interpreters for it, but I don't have any other systems so I can't
test  it or give detailed instructions. &nbsp;The Linux instructions will
be extremely  relevant to other *nix OS users, and may be useful to others
too.</p>
<h2><a name="running"></a>
    Running FreeGuide</h2>
<p>The first time you run FreeGuide you will be confronted with the download
  screen, because no programmes have been downloaded. &nbsp;Click on "Options"
  to choose your channels. &nbsp;In the list box on the Options screen you
 may choose your required channels by clicking on them while holding down
the Ctrl button on the keyboard. &nbsp;You'll notice that some channels are
already selected - these are some ones I watch. You can start with these
if you like, or get rid of them all by clicking on a channel without using
Ctrl, and then carrying on with Ctrl held down. When you have finished choosing
your channels, click "OK". &nbsp;Make sure you're connected to the Internet,
and then click on "Download...".</p>
<p>After a short wait, you should see today's listings of the channels you
  selected. &nbsp;On this screen time advances from left to right (click
"Go   To Now" to see what's on now), and the channels are shown one below
another.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>The + and - buttons change the day you are looking at, or you can choose
  a day from the list.</p>
<p>You can click the tick box at the top left corner of a programme to add
  it to your personalised TV guide for today, which is shown in the bottom
 section of the window. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make programmes be ticked automatically by adding them to your
  favourites list (choose the "Tools" menu and then "Favourites"). &nbsp;Any
  programme whose title contains some text matching a favourite will be ticked
  automatically. &nbsp;You can always un-tick programmes if you wish.</p>
<p>Clicking "Print Listing" will open up your web browser with your customised
  TV guide, and you can print it from there by choosing "File" and then "Print".</p>
<p>To change various options choose the "Tools" menu and then "Options".
&nbsp;To download more listings, choose "Tools" and then "Download Listings"
(FreeGuide will take you to this screen automatically when you run out of
listings).</p>
<p>Please note that v0.1 does not delete old listings files, so you may wish
  to remove then from the data directory ("C:\Program Files\FreeGuide\org\freeguide-tv\data\")
  if they are filling up you hard disk.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="notes"></a>
  Notes</h2>
<p>There are lots of things you can fiddle with on the Advanced and View
tabs of the Options screen. &nbsp;I haven't bothered to document them here
because they are intended primarily to be set up before distribution. What
I mean is that they give me the flexibility to distribute viewers with different
 parsers etc. without the need to recompile or alter the program.</p>
<p>There are some bugs in this release, most notably the strange fast scrolling
 behaviour that happens when you re-enter the listings view screen from somewhere
 else (or when you change the day). Any advice, help or code on this problem
 would be gratefully received. Other bugs include&nbsp;generally  not dealing
 well with unexpected things, and doubtless many things I don't know about.</p>
<p>If FreeGuide used to work for you and has now stopped, it is probably
because the web site it grabs listings from has changed its format. &nbsp;Check
back at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freeguide-tv</a>
   for updated parsers.<br>
</p>
<p>My immediate plans are to make one more Java version with a proper installer
 that make lifes very easy, especially for Windows users. However, the Java/Perl
 setup is really a prototype for a final version, which I hope to write in
 C++ using wxWindows. This version will have standard easy installation and
 will allow seamless downloading of new parsers when required. The first
thing  I need to do for this is learn C++, so don't hold your breath. &nbsp;Again,
 any help appreciated.<br>
