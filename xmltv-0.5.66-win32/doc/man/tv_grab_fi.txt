DESCRIPTION
    Grab TV listings for several channels available in Finland. The data
    comes from various sources, e.g. www.telkku.com. The grabber relies on
    parsing HTML, so it might stop working when the web page layout is
    changed.

    You need to run "tv_grab_fi --configure" first to create the channel
    configuration for your setup. Subsequently runs of "tv_grab_fi" will
    grab the latest data, process them and produce XML data on the standard
    output.

COMMANDS
    NONE    Grab mode.

    --capabilities
            Show the capabilities this grabber supports. See also
            <http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XmltvCapabilities>.

    --configure
            Generate the configuration file by asking the users which
            channels to grab.

    --description
            Print the description for this grabber.

    --help|-h|-?
            Show this help page.

    --list-channels
            Fetch all available channels from the various sources and write
            them to the standard output.

    --version
            Show the version of this grabber.

GENERIC OPTIONS
    --cache FILE
            File name to cache the fetched HTML data in. This speeds up
            subsequent runs using the same data.

    --gui [OPTION]
            Enable the graphical user interface. If you don't specify OPTION
            then XMLTV will automatically choose the best available GUI.
            Allowed values are:

            Term
                Terminal output with a progress bar

            TermNoProgressBar
                Terminal output without progress bar

            Tk  Tk-based GUI

    --quiet Suppress any progress messages to the standard output.

CONFIGURE MODE OPTIONS
    --config-file FILE
            File name to write the configuration to.

            Default is $HOME/.xmltv/tv_grab_fi.conf.

GRAB MODE OPTIONS
    --config-file FILE
            File name to read the configuration from.

            Default is $HOME/.xmltv/tv_grab_fi.conf.

    --days "N"
            Grab "N" days of TV data.

            Default is 14 days.

    --no-randomize
            Grab TV data in deterministic order, i.e. first fetch channel 1,
            days 1 to N, then channel 2, and so on.

            Default is to use a random access pattern. If you only grab TV
            data from one source then the randomizing is a no-op.

    --offset "N"
            Grab TV data starting at "N" days in the future.

            Default is 0, i.e. today.

    --output FILE
            Write the XML data to FILE instead of the standard output.

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
    The configuration file is line oriented, each line can contain one
    command. Empty lines and everything after the "#" comment character is
    ignored. Supported commands are:

    channel ID NAME
            Grab information for this channel. "ID" depends on the source,
            "NAME" is ignored and forwarded as is to the XMLTV output file.
            This information can be automatically generated using the
            grabber in the configuration mode.

    series description NAME
            If a programme title matches "NAME" then the first sentence of
            the description, i.e. everything up to the first period ("."),
            question mark ("?") or exclamation mark ("!"), is removed from
            the description and is used as the name of the episode.

    series title NAME
            If a programme title contains a colon (":") then the grabber
            checks if the left-hand side of the colon matches "NAME". If it
            does then the left-hand side is used as programme title and the
            right-hand side as the name of the episode.

    title map "FROM" 'TO'
            If the programme title starts with the string "FROM" then
            replace this part with the string "TO". The strings must be
            enclosed in single quotes ("'") or double quotes ("""). The
            title mapping occurs before the "series" command processing.

    title strip parental level
            At the beginning of 2012 some programme descriptions started to
            include parental levels at the end of the title, e.g. "(S)".
            With this command all parental levels will be removed from the
            titles automatically. This removal occurs before the title
            mapping.

BUGS
    The channels are identified by channel number rather than the RFC2838
    form recommended by the XMLTV DTD.
