DESCRIPTION
    Outputs TV listings in XMLTV format for stations available in North
    America. Data is provided by TVMedia Inc.

    The grabber requires an _active_ subscription to XMLTVListings.com, as
    well as at least one lineup selected from your account page. Then you
    can run tv_grab_na_tvmedia --configure to set your API key and which
    lineup you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_na_tvmedia with no arguments will get listings for
    all the channels you in your lineup, as you configured on
    XMLTVListings.com
