NAME
    tv_cat - Concatenate XMLTV listings files.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_cat [--help] [--utf8] [--output FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
    Read one or more XMLTV files and write a file to standard ouput whose
    programmes are the concatenation of the programmes in the input files,
    and whose channels are the union of the channels in the input files.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output

    The treatment of programmes and channels is slightly different because
    for programmes, the ordering is important (typically programmes are
    processed or displayed in the same order as they appear in the input)
    whereas channels are just a set indexed by channel id. There is a
    warning if channel details clash for the same id.

    One more wrinkle is the credits (source, generator and so on), they are
    taken from one of the files and then there's a warning if the other
    files differ. If two input files have different character encodings,
    then it is not meaningful to combine their data (without recoding or
    other processing) and tv_cat die with an error message.

    But if you do want to combine multiple input files with different
    character encodings then you can use the --utf8 command-line parameter
    which will create a combined output file in UTF-8 format. (Note: it is
    not safe to combine mixed encodings to anything other than UTF-8 so no
    other output encoding is provided for.) (Note 2: any input file which
    does not have an encoding specified in the xml tag is not only naughty
    but is assumed to already be UTF-8, which may not be true!)

    This tool is rather useless, but it makes a good testbed for the XMLTV
    module.
