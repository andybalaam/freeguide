NAME
    tv_grab_uk_tvguide - Grab TV listings for UK from the TV Guide UK
    website.

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many channels available in UK.
    The data come from tvguide.co.uk

    First you must run tv_grab_uk_tvguide --configure to choose which
    channels you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_uk_tvguide with no arguments will get a listings in
    XML format for the channels you chose for available days including
    today.

OPTIONS
    Please see tv_grab_uk_tvguide --help

INSTALLATION
    The file tv_grab_uk_tvguide.map.conf has two purposes. Firstly you can
    map the channel ids used by the site into something more meaningful to
    your PVR. E.g.

          map==74==BBC 1

    will change "74" to "BBC 1" in the output XML.

    Note: the lines are of the form "map=={channel id}=={my name}".

    The second purpose is to likewise translate genre names. So if your PVR
    doesn"t have a category for "Science Fiction" but uses "Sci-fi" instead,
    then you can specify

          cat==Science Fiction==Sci-fi

    and the output XML will have "Sci-fi".

    IMPORTANT: the downloaded "tv_grab_uk_tvguide.map.conf" contains example
    lines to illustrate the format - you should edit this file to suit your
    own purposes!

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.

SUPPORTED CHANNELS
    For information on supported channels, see http://tvguide.co.uk/

XMLTV VALIDATION
    tv_validate_grabber may report an error similar to:

          "Line 5 Invalid channel-id BBC 1"

    This is a because ValidateFile.pm insists the channel-id adheres to
    RFC2838 despite the xmltv.dtd only saying "preferably" not "SHOULD".
    (Having channel ids of the form "bbc1.bbc.co.uk" will be rejected by
    many PVRs since they require the data to match their own list.)

    It may also report:

          "tv_sort failed on the concatenated data. Probably due to overlapping data between days."

    Both these errors can be ignored.

DISCLAIMER
    The TV Guide website"s license for these data does not allow
    non-personal use.

    Certainly any commercial use of listings data obtained by using this
    grabber will breach copyright law, but if you are just using the data
    for your own personal use then you are probably fine.

    own personal use only and you absolve the author(s) from any liability
