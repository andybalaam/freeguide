NAME
    tv_merge - Merge (combine) two XMLTV files.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_merge -i FILE -m FILE -o FILE

DESCRIPTION
    Read XMLTV listings from two files and merge them together. Unlike
    tv_cat (which just joins files) this will update (add/replace/delete)
    the origin XMLTV file with channels and programmes contained in the
    second file.

    It works with multiple channels, and will insert any new programmes and
    delete any overlapping programmes.

    IMPORTANT The input files must be pre-sorted into datetime within
    channel order by using the "--by-channel" option to tv_sort e.g. tv_sort
    --by-channel --output FILE FILE

    All programmes must have start and stop times.

    (Note: Programmes in the merged-in file *replace* any in the master
    file, i.e. data are not updated *within* programmes)

    This program uses XML::TreePP which doesn't write <DOCTYPE> definitions
    in the output file. If you need to add a suitable <DOCTYPE> tag then use
    the -t parameter. e.g. tv_merge -i FILE -m FILE -o FILE -t

EXAMPLE
    Use "tv_merge -i master.xml -m newadditions.xml -o newmaster.xml" to
    merge all channels/programmes in newadditions.xml.
