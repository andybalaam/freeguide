DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many channels available in UK.
    The data come from <http://atlas.metabroadcast.com>

    First you must run tv_grab_uk_atlas --configure to choose which channels
    you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_uk_atlas with no arguments will get a listings in
    XML format for the channels you chose for available days including
    today.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which channels to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_uk_atlas.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --hours N When grabbing, grab N hours of data.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than all available days.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today/now + N days. When --hours is used
    this is number of hours instead of days. N may be negative.

    --date N Grab just this date (instead of days/offset).

    --dst Some PVRs have trouble with BST times and "lose" an hour at the
    end of the day schedule. This adds an extra hour to the schedule
    fetched.

    --channel S Grab just this channel (ignore the channels in the config
    file). Can be specified either as Atlas channel id (e.g. "cbbw") or
    mapped channel name (e.g. "south.bbc1.bbc.co.uk").

    --quiet Suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available in the current configuration.

    --list-lineups Write output giving list of available viewing regions.

    --get-lineup Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available in the current lineup.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see <http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XmltvCapabilities>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

    --info Print a help page and exit.

INSTALLATION
    1. First you must obtain an Atlas API key from MetaBroadcast. This is
    free (at the present time) for personal use and is necessary to allow
    you to access the full schedule published by the Press Association. Any
    commercial use of the data obtained from Atlas will require a paid-for
    license.

    Instructions are available here:
    <http://metabroadcast.com/blog/create-and-manage-your-atlas-api-key>

    You will need to enter your API key during the --configure stage.

    Remember to request Press Association (PA) as the content provider on
    your Atlas API key.

    2. Grabber configuration consists of the usual: tv_grab_uk_atlas
    --configure

    Atlas have regionalised data which means you can obtain listings
    specific to your TV region. When you run the --configure option you will
    be asked which viewing platform (e.g. Freeview; Sky HD) and region (e.g.
    London; South East) you wish to access. (You can select only 1 region!).

    Then you select which channels you want to fetch.

    3. The file tv_grab_uk_atlas.user.map.conf has two purposes. Firstly you
    can map the channel ids used by Atlas into something more meaningful to
    your PVR. E.g.

          map==cbdm==FILM4

    will change "cbdm" to "FILM4" in the output XML.

    Note: the lines are of the form "map=={channel id}=={my name}".

    The second purpose is to likewise translate genre names. So if your PVR
    doesn"t have a category for "Science Fiction" but uses "Sci-fi" instead,
    then you can specify

          cat==Science Fiction==Sci-fi

    and the output XML will have "Sci-fi".

    IMPORTANT: the downloaded "tv_grab_uk_atlas.user.map.conf" contains
    example lines to illustrate the format - you should edit this file to
    suit your own purposes!

USAGE
    All the normal XMLTV capabilities are included but there is an
    additional parameter "--hours". Atlas allows schedule data to be
    retrieved either by number-of-days or by number-of-hours.

    Where possible you should use this "hours" facility to reduce
    unnecessary load on the Atlas server.

    When --hours is specified the --offset is interpreted as hours.

    For example:

       - to retrieve a schedule for the next 12 hours:

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --hours 12

       - to retrieve a schedule for the next 12 hours starting tomorrow:

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --hours 12 --offset 24

    Alternatively you can use the familiar "days" format:

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1 --offset 1

    Negative numbers are allowed, so for example the following are valid:

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -4 --hours 12

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -1 --days 1

    Note that Atlas only has data for a maximum 14 days ahead and it varies;
    some channels have less than this.

    An additional parameter "--date YYYYMMDD" allows you to fetch the
    schedule just for this date. (This is obviously similar to --days 1 with
    an appropriate --offset but avoids you having to calculate the offset;
    this is easier for some automated fetchers.) E.g.

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --date 20130923

    A new parameter "--dst" allows you to add an extra hour to the schedule
    fetched from Atlas. Some PVRs have trouble with BST times and "lose" an
    hour at the end of the day"s schedule. This parameter might help to
    alleviate that.

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --days 1 --dst

    A new parameter "--channel" allows you to override the config file and
    retrieve data for a specific channel:

            tv_grab_uk_atlas --offset -4 --hours 12 --channel cbdm

BROWSER INTERFACE
    If you wish to run the fetcher via a browser then you can install the
    supplied cgi script.

    (Note you must obviously have a webserver installed or be using a
    web-host for this to work.)

    Copy the file getatlas.pl into the cgi-enabled directory on your web
    space. (Hint: This directory is often called "cgi-bin".) Ensure the file
    has execute permission.

    (Tech note: use a "normal" cgi handler to run this file; fastcgi may not
    work.)

    Specify the parameters on the URI as follows: offset=xxxx hours=xxxx
    days=xxxx date=YYYYMMDD channel=xxxx dst

       e.g.   
          http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?hours=12
          http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?hours=12&offset=6
          http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?date=20130930
          http://my.webspace.com/cgi-bin/getatlas.pl?days=1&dst

    Valid combinations are: "offset" and "hours" or "offset" and "days" - in
    which case the offset is "days" also (otherwise it"s "hours") or "date"
    - fetch just this day

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.

SUPPORTED CHANNELS
    For information on supported channels, see
    $HOME/.xmltv/supplement/tv_grab_uk_atlas/tv_grab_uk_atlas.map.channels.c
    onf

XMLTV VALIDATION
    tv_validate_grabber may report an error similar to:

          "Line 5 Invalid channel-id BBC 1"

    This is a because ValidateFile.pm insists the channel-id adheres to
    RFC2838 despite the xmltv.dtd only saying "preferably" not "SHOULD".
    (Having channel ids of the form "bbc1.bbc.co.uk" will be rejected by
    many PVRs since they require the data to match their own list.)

    This error can be ignored.

FAQs
    1. What does "Enter your Atlas API key" mean?

    You must obtain an API key free from Atlas MetaBroadcast before you can
    use this grabber. Instructions are available here:
    <http://metabroadcast.com/blog/getting-full-uk-listings-data-from-atlas-
    it-s-easy>

    2. I"m getting the error "Status: 400 Bad Request"

    Typically this is because you haven"t entered your API key during the
    --configure stage. Or your API key does not allow access to Press
    Association data (log-in to your account at
    http://atlas.metabroadcast.com/admin and "Request Access" to "PA" source
    data). Or if you requested a particular channel with the --channel
    option but the channel cannot be found.

DISCLAIMER
    The MetaBroadcast free license for these data does not allow
    non-personal use.

    Certainly any commercial use of listings data obtained by using this
    grabber will breach copyright law, but if you are just using the data
    for your own personal use then you are probably fine.

    By using this grabber you aver you are using the listings data for your
    own personal use only and you absolve the author(s) from any liability
    under copyright law or otherwise.
