                          FreeGuide 0.4 INSTALL-linux

   These are Linux installation instructions. For Windows installation
   instructions see [1]INSTALL-windows.html.

Prerequisites

   To use FreeGuide you need:
     * The [2]Java 2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or above. You can
       check this by typing java -version in a command-line window.
     * The [3]XMLTV package version 0.5 or above. This in turn needs
       [4]Perl (which almost everyone already has). XMLTV is a little
       tricky to install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from
       CPAN. Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README
       that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end. Help is
       always available from [5]xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
     * If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution
       you got, you need to download it from the [6]FreeGuide download
       site and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually
       /usr/bin/). Linux users need "tv_split" (i.e. not the ".exe" file
       - that's for Windows. Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV
       distribution soon.

Installation

   When you've got these, download the [7]FreeGuide binary zip and unzip
   it into your home directory. It should make two directories:
   "freeguide-tv" and ".xmltv/freeguide-tv".

   The first thing you need to do is configure your XMLTV grabber.
   Connect to the Internet and open a terminal window, change to the
   directory containing the XMLTV tools and run your grabber with the
   --configure option. For example, if you live in the UK you should type
   tv_grab_uk --configure, and if you live in North America you should
   type tv_grab_na --configure. Follow the instructions to set up your
   grabber. FreeGuide needs the configuration file generated to know what
   channels you want.

   You can now run FreeGuide by running "runfreeguide.sh" in the
   "freeguide-tv" directory. It will take you through a wizard to set
   everything up, but you should be able to click "Next" at every stage
   if you've installed it exactly as shown above.

   See the [8]README for info on how to use FreeGuide.

   If you have any problems, [9]contact us and we'll sort you out.
