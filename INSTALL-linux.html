<h1>FreeGuide 0.4 INSTALL-linux</h1>

<p>These are Linux installation instructions.  For Windows installation instructions see <a href="INSTALL-windows.html">INSTALL-windows.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To use FreeGuide you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2 Runtime Environment</a> version 1.4 or above.  You can check this by typing <tt>java -version</tt> in a command-line window.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39046">XMLTV</a> package version 0.5 or above.  This in turn needs <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Perl</a> (which almost everyone already has).  XMLTV is a little tricky to install as it has lots of prerequisites you need from CPAN.  Persevere with this, using the instructions in the README that comes with XMLTV, and you'll get there in the end.  Help is always available from <a href="mailto:xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">xmltv-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</li>
<li>If the "tv_split" tool isn't included in the XMLTV distribution you got, you need to download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide download site</a> and put it in the same directory as the XMLTV tools (usually /usr/bin/).  Linux users need "tv_split" (i.e. not the ".exe" file - that's for Windows.  Hopefully this will be included in the XMLTV distribution soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>When you've got these, download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35309">FreeGuide binary</a> zip and unzip it into your home directory.  It should make two directories: "freeguide-tv" and ".xmltv/freeguide-tv".</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is configure your XMLTV grabber.  Connect to the Internet and open a terminal window, change to the directory containing the XMLTV tools and run your grabber with the --configure option.  For example, if you live in the UK you should type <tt>tv_grab_uk --configure</tt>, and if you live in North America you should type <tt>tv_grab_na --configure</tt>.  Follow the instructions to set up your grabber.  FreeGuide needs the configuration file generated to know what channels you want.</p>

<p>You can now run FreeGuide by running "runfreeguide.sh" in the "freeguide-tv" directory.  It will take you through a wizard to set everything up, but you should be able to click "Next" at every stage if you've installed it exactly as shown above.</p>

<p>See the <a href="README.html">README</a> for info on how to use FreeGuide.</p>
