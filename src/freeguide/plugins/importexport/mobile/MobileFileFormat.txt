   Description of files format for Mobile Export Plugin.

  Mobile File Format was designed for export TV schedule data into mobile devices and for support 
http://tv.zaval.org site. Main features are :
  - binary format instead XML format. It makes performance better, because XML parsing is not 
    so fast on mobile devices
  - compressed format, which allow uncompression-on-fly. It makes files much smaller.

  Data package includes several files for one TV schedule. There are one "list" file and many "date"
files for each schedule.


    Some notes about store predefined types.
  Binary number types stored in "big-endian"(or "network") format like DataOutputStream in Java.
  
  Strings stored like DataOutputStream.writeUTF: First, two bytes are written to out. This value is the number
of bytes actually written out, not the length of the string. Following the length, each character
of the string is output, in sequence, using the modified UTF-8 encoding for the character.


    Format of "list" file.
  "list" file should be named as "list" and includes info about all channels in the TV schedule.

bytes   type    description
0-1     short   Format version. Should be 1 for current version.
2-3     short   Channels number(N)
...     string  channel ID of channel 0
...     string  channel Title of channel 0
...     string  channel ID of channel 1
...     string  channel Title of channel 1
.....................................................
...     string  channel ID of channel N-1
...     string  channel Title of channel N-1


    Format of "date" file.
  "date" file should be named as SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd") mask. For example, 2006-12-25.
One file contains information about one day for all channels. It's very useful for remove old data - we can
just remove old files.
