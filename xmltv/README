XMLTV 0.4

Suite of programs for processing TV listings and organizing your
viewing.

You can grab TV listings for the USA, Canada and the UK.  They are
stored in an XML format.  Then you can sort them, filter them and
print them out.  There is a CGI script to help automate choosing what
to watch, and a program to track schedule changes and notify when a
programme isn't in its usual timeslot.

This release has changes to the file format: now there is a single XML
document containing both channels and programmes.  It has bugfixes and
enhancements to the two listings-grabbers and the addition of the
tvcheck script.

There is a known bug in getlistings_na where sometimes the data
grabbed for some channels (particularly programme stop times) can be
wrong.  This doesn't happen most of the time.
