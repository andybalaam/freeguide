# parse_uk_date()
# 
# Wrapper for ParseDate() that tries to guess what timezone a date is
# in (UT or BST).  If the date already has either of these it is left
# alone.
# 
# This will probably fail horribly if you use it for dates which
# aren't in either of these timezones.  But since summer time starts
# and ends at the same time throughout the EU it wouldn't be hard to
# make it work for some other countries.
# 
# Parameters:
#   unparsed date from the UK (or other places using UT/BST)
# 
#   (optional) timezone to assume if ambiguous (defaults to BST if not
#   given or 'false')
# 
# Returns: parsed date, or undef if error
# 
# There's a one hour window where dates are ambigous; we assume UT for
# these.  Similarly there's a one hour window
# where dates without a timezone are impossible; we return undef on
# those.
