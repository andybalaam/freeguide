DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and listings in XMLTV format for many stations available in
    Sweden. Data is downloaded from http://tv.swedb.se/ by default.

    First you must run tv_grab_se_swedb --configure to choose which stations
    you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_se_swedb with no arguments will get a listings for
    the stations you chose for five days including today.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_se_swedb.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than 5.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --channel xmltvid Disregard configuration file and only grab data for
    the specified channel(s). The parameter is a commaseparated list of
    xmltv channel-ids.

    --list-channels Output a list of all channels that data is available
    for. The list is in xmltv-format.

    --root-url url Specify the url of the file describing all available
    channels. The default is http://tv.swedb.se/xmltv/channels.xml.gz. The
    value passed in here when running with --configure is stored in the
    configuration file and used in all subsequent runs of the grabber.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.
