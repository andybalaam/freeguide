NAME
    tv_grab_nl - Grab TV listings for Holland.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_nl --help

    tv_grab_nl [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_nl [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet] [--slow]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Holland. The data
    comes from www.tvgids.nl. The grabber relies on parsing HTML so it might
    stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_nl --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_nl with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_nl.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is one week.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --slow Fetch full programme details from the site. This gives richer
    output but involves many more page fetches.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.
