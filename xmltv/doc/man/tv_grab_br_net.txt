    tv_grab_br_net --list-channels [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE]
    [--quiet]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Brazil from the
    widely present NET cable provider. The data comes from nettv.globo.com
    which is their web page containing program information. The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_br_net --configure to choose your city, your lineup
    and which channels you want to download. Should your city not be listed
    even though NET has it on their homepage...sorry, they are using 2
    different formats. Only one is implemented here. Please see KNOWN
    PROBLEMS.

    Then running tv_grab_br_net with no arguments will output listings in
    XML format to standard output.

OPTIONS
    --configure Ask for configuration-data, which channels to download and
    write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_br_net.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is five.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today (=zero). Set to -1 to grab data beginning yesterday.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (using the city and selection from the config file), but no
    programs. All channels are listed. Even those without any information
    about broadcasts.

    --slow Overrides the default set by the configuration. It enables the
    long strategy run: There is only basic information listed on the main
    channel page. However there is a lot more provided on subsequent pages
    for particular broadcasts. If you'd like to parse the data from these
    pages as well, set it in the configuration or supply this flag. But
    consider that the grab process takes much much longer when doing so,
    since many more web pages have to be retrieved. Please note that this
    option is a non-standard extension to the XMLTV-options and should be
    specified at configuration-time.

    --fast Overrides the default set by the configuration. It switches back
    to fast operation if the configuration specified slow. Please note that
    this option is a non-standard extension to the XMLTV-options and should
    be specified at configuration-time.

    --relax N May be used if time is not an issue, bandwidth is limited or
    you don't want to pound the NET Website (good idea). It adds a sleep
    after fetching each page. The number of seconds paused is random and
    between 1 and N. Since this also is a non-standard extension, you should
    consider setting it in the configuration. The commandline-option is only
    meant to override the config.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

TODO
    - translate user-interface and documentation to Portuguese
    - use existing XML and gather more details by using the URL of the
    broadcasts
    - logos/images (impossible because not implemented by the NET website)
    - further preparation for new features in XMLTV 0.6

KNOWN PROBLEMS
    For some channels it seems NET has no data available whatsoever. When
    grabbing data for "today" or "tomorrow" these channels will
    automatically be commented out in the used configuration-file. This
    should not disturb any functionality unless you're keen for "empty"
    channels.

    The NET website is sometimes inconsistent and buggy. And while the
    grabber might work perfect for some cities, it might not even be
    configurable for others. This is due to the bundles/selections they
    offer for the particular cities. It looks like for some cities the site
    works completely different :-(

    Here a way to determine if your city is one of those that are different
    and not supported:

    1) Direct your browser to *http://nettv.globo.com/NETServ/br/home/*
    2) Select São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro (they're known to be working)
    3) After accepting the cookie enter this URL:
        *http://nettv.globo.com/NETServ/br/home/indexnet.jsp?id=35*

    4) Check if your city is still in the select-list on top of the page. If
    not - sorry, you're not lucky today :-(

    As of now there is no solution or workaround for this problem. Let me
    know if you find a workaround or want to implement a different grabber
    for the so far unsupported cities.
