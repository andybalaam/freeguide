DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and radio listings in XMLTV format for many stations available
    in Belgium. The data comes from the Sanoma magazines' websites: Tele
    Moustique and Teve Blad.

USAGE
    First you must run tv_grab_be --configure to choose the language, grab
    mode and which stations you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_be with no arguments will get about 6 day's of
    summary only listings for the channels you chose.

    If you want to grab detailed information (such as episode name, detailed
    descriptions, actors) then use the --slow flag when both onfiguring and
    running the grabber. The configure mode will prompt you for selection
    criteria for when the grabber should retrieve detailed information for
    programmes (selected by start time, category, and channel). This makes
    grabbing slow (hence the option name!)

    Note that different stations ar available in French and Dutch modes due
    to the listings differences from the two sites. The data is also
    different -- the French site has more detailed info for the french
    language channels, and the Dutch site has more info for the Dutch
    language channels.

    Some channels (BBC World, Euronews) although listed, have such bad
    listings data that you would be better off using the tv_grab_uk_rt
    grabber, and then merging the resulting files with tv_cat!

    It is perhaps worthwhile to use the --config-file option to maintain one
    config file with a selection of channels for each language, then using
    tv_cat to merge the resulting XML files.

    --configure Prompt for language, grab mode and which stations to
    download and write the configuration file (see also --slow)

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_be.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than as many as possible.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N. N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow Slow mode: get detailed information for specified programmes.
    With --configure, this enables the configuration routine to prompt for
    the criteria which programs have to match for detailed information
    downloading. Otherwise, this enables the grabbing of detailed for
    programmes matching the defined criteria.

    --trace Show debug information (if Log::TraceMessages is installed)

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --list-channels Dump channel information for all channels but no
    programmes. This grabber needs a config file first before the channels
    can be dumped.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see
    <http://membled.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmltvCapabilities>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

WARNING
    In --slow mode, unning this grabber requires very many web page fetches
    (one per channel per day, and then one per programme selected for
    detailed information) from a very slow web site.

    The number of web page fetches can be limited by limiting the number of
    programs to get detailed information for (by start time range, category
    or channel). This is defined when run with --configure --slow or in the
    config file.

BUGS
    The website parsing isn't perfect and there may be warning messages
    about bits of HTML that aren't understood. Some of the details provided
    by the site have to be thrown away because they cannot be accommodated
    in the XMLTV format; again, warning messages are printed.

    Programmes containing defined sections are not handled very well (such
    as Sportpaleis on Canvas) because the data source lists the sections
    separately with overlapping timeslots. eg:

    "13.30-14.00 Hands Up!"
    "13.30-17.30 Sportpaleis"
    "14.00 14.30 Champions League Magazine"
    "14.30 17.00 Wielrennen: Kuurne - Brussel - Kuurne"
    "17.00 17.15 Autorennen: F1"
    "17.15 17.30 Daar is 'm!"

    The data on the website can also be poor. Program names gain and lose
    random punctuation from week to week. eg:

    "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.",
    "Buffy the Vampire Slayer",
    "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer",
    "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

    The grabber strips trailing punctuation to help avoid this.

    Sometimes the stop time is not put on last programme of the day. This
    can be worked around by piping the output through tv_sort, and the start
    time of the first program of the next day will be used. Alternatively,
    the following complex tv_grep command can add an implicit stop time of
    06:00:

    tv_grep -e 'if (not ${$_}{stop}) { (${$_}{stop} = ${$_}{start}) =~
    s/\d{6}\b/060000/ }; 1'

    Finally there are several things still to do (see TODO list in source
    code for full description).

HISTORY
    2007-01-09 nielm - switch back to telemoustique for fr

    2004-01-08 nielm - first version with selective detail grabbing, based
    on tv_grab_uk_rt 0.5.27

    2004-01-09 nielm - Disable detail grabbing by default; implemented
    --slow option to enable detail grabbing and to complicate configuration
    procedure; . Removed implicit generation of stop time. Correct windows
    special characters (128-159): oe ligatures -> oe; fancy quotes -> normal
    quotes, others -> ? (with warning); Fixed warning about
    Log::Tracemessages::On.

    2004-01-13 nielm - Replace '...' Windows character; Added parsing of
    star ratings; warn about unrecognised images in description text; Added
    parsing of movie ratings (classifications); Future-proof config file to
    cope with grabbing multiple languages simultaneously; Added --output
    option

    2004-01-15 nielm - Put year into date tag; Put director of films (if
    found in descr) into director tag; Get year from descr if not found, add
    channel logos (from satlogo.com).

    2004-01-26 nielm - handle VO/OV image without warning; make multi-line
    descriptions; correct date parsing; correct episode num in FR listings;
    correct stop time bug when no stop time defined; removed lang=xx from
    title and sub-title;

    2004-01-29 nielm - add icons in rating and star-rating; handle episode
    numbers in titles better; handle extracting of director better.

    2004-02-23 nielm/epaepa - tidy up of help text, remove newlines from
    desc, improve start/stop time details matching, add detaul URL to fast
    mode programme info

    2004-03-04 nielm - Correct usage, handle Duree (length), handle repeats
    (previously-shown), handle episode numbers in description. More things
    added to TODO list (see source code)

    2004-03-09 nielm - Remove Duree and (R.) from description text. Remove
    categories in description. Do not put episode numbers in sub-title

    2004-04-01 nielm - Fixed bug with no stop time for programs starting at
    midnight, handle 'New' icon, Fixed JIMTV channel ID, handle 'Divers'
    tags (which may contain info on previously-shown), remove 'gastacteurs:'
    from actor names.

    2004-04-05 epaepa/nielm - Make time zones consistantly +0100 or +0200,
    but never mixed. Clean up punctuation around actor names. Remove
    duplicate ChannelID from file (only put alternative ID's). better actor
    parsing

    2004-04-05 epaepa/nielm - Handle user input better during config
    (CTRL-D, CTRL-H), use substrings not regexps for category/channel
    matching to avoid nastyness when a user enters a bad regexp. Add magic
    category *NONE* and *ALL* for category matching.

    2004-04-15 nielm - yet more cleanup in parsing actor names, ignore
    programmes with no titles.

    2005-03-12 nielm - no function changes: just changes to the
    configuration section to use XMLTV::ask, and updates to the channel_ids
    files

    2005-09-22 nielm - www.telemoustique.be no longer works: quick and dirty
    fix: use www.telepocket.be instead.
