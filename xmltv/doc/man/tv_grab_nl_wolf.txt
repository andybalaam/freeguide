NAME
    tv_grab_nl_wolf - Grab TV listings for Holland.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_nl_wolf --help

    tv_grab_nl_wolf [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N] [--quiet]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in the Netherlands.
    The data comes from Carlo de Wolf's site exporting listings in XMLTV
    format. The default is to grab as many days as possible from the current
    day onwards.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days starting from today, rather than as many as
    possible.

    --offset N Start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.
    N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The grabber fetches data from the site with little processing. This
    means that if the upstream data is incorrect, the output of the grabber
    will be wrong. There are some fixes to correct errors such as stop <
    start, but others may creep in undetected.
