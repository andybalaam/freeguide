DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Iceland. The data
    comes from www.sjonvarp.is. The grabber relies on parsing HTML so it
    might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_is --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_is with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_is.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is as many as the source carries.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.
