DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Switzerland and
    (partly) central Europe. The data comes from www.fernsehen.ch. The
    grabber relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_ch --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_ch with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Ask for each available channel whether to download and write
    the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_ch.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is fourteen.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from now
    on (= zero).

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

    Some channels, like for example SAT.1 and RTL-2, sometimes broadcast
    different programmes in different regions, i.e. the programmes broadcast
    in Switzerland differ from the programmes shown in Germany.
    Unfortunately fernsehen.ch tends to supply both programmes in one
    channel listing, making it hard for the grabber to decide which
    programme to write out. By default it tends to write the first, however
    you can overwrite this in the configuration file. Simply add a line
    telling last plus the channel id, e.g. "last RT2" for RTL-2.
