DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in France (Hertzian,
    Cable/satellite, Canal+ Sat, TPS). The data comes from
    telepoche.guidetele.com. The default is to grab as many days as possible
    from the current day onwards. By default the program description are not
    downloaded, so if you want description and ratings, you should active
    the --slow option.

    --configure Grab channels informations from the website and ask for
    channel type and names.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days starting from today, rather than as many as
    possible. Due to the website organization, the speed is exactly the
    same, whatever the number of days is until you activate the --slow
    option. If --slow is not specified, --days will thus only filter the
    data without speeding up the grabber.

    --offset N Start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.
    N may be negative. Due to the website organization, N cannot be inferior
    to -1. As with --days, this is only useful for limiting downloads in
    --slow mode.

    --slow Get additional information from the website, like program
    description, reviews and credits.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.
