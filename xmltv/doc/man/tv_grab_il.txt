SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_il --help

    tv_grab_il [--config-file FILE] --configure [--gui OPTION]

    tv_grab_il [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet] [--gui OPTION] [--list-channels]

DESCRIPTION
    Outputs TV listings for channels available in Israel (free to air, cable
    and satellite). The data is obtained from parsing web pages from the
    Israeli portal walla (from tv.walla.co.il) and www.tv2day.co.il

    First run tv_grab_il --configure to decide which channels to download.
    There is a long list. You may want to select none when it asks you for
    which channels and manually edit the configuration file to uncomment the
    channels you wish to tape. Then run tv_grab_il with no arguments to
    output the listing in XML format to the standard output.

    To view the hebrew, you will need to set your terminal to have a unicode
    font that supports hebrew.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.
    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_il.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --grabber S Select tvguide source(yestvguide-ru, yestvguide-he, walla)),
    default is yestvguide-ru

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --days N Grab *N* days. The default is 7.

    --offset N Start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.
    N may be negative. Due to the website organization, N cannot be inferior
    to -1.

    --xmltvid-template S Use 'S' as a template for generating XMLTV IDs,
    default is %CHANNEL%-%DOMAIN%

    B[--gui OPTION] Use GUI mode (term or tk)

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The summer time routine uses the European summer time start and stop
    dates which are different to those used in Israel. The correct times can
